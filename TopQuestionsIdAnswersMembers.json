Potassium is critical for the normal functioning of the muscles, heart, and nerves. It plays an important role in controlling activity of smooth muscle (such as the muscle found in the digestive tract) and skeletal muscle (muscles of the extremities and torso), as well as the muscles of the heart. It is also important for normal transmission of electrical signals throughout the nervous system within the body. Normal blood levels of potassium are critical for maintaining normal heart electrical rhythm. Low blood potassium levels (hypokalemia) and high blood potassium levels (hyperkalemia) can lead to abnormal heart rhythms. The most important clinical effect of hyperkalemia is related to electrical rhythm of the heart. While mild hyperkalemia probably has a limited effect on the heart, moderate hyperkalemia can produce ECG changes (ECG is an electrical reading of the heart muscles), and severe hyperkalemia can cause suppression of electrical activity of the heart and can cause the heart to stop beating. Another important effect of hyperkalemia is interference with functioning of the skeletal muscles. Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis is a rare inherited disorder in which patients can develop sudden onset of hyperkalemia, which causes muscle paralysis. The reason for the muscle paralysis is not clearly understood, but it is probably due to hyperkalemia suppressing the electrical activity of the muscles.

Pneumonia can affect just one lobe of the right or left lung, a whole lung, or both lungs Many different kinds of germs infect the lungs and cause pneumonia. Infected lungs leak fluids and shed dead cells. This material clogs up air sacs and makes it hard for the lungs to do their job of getting oxygen into the blood. Without enough oxygen, none of the cells in your body work as they should. Pneumonia generally lasts about two weeks.

The sputum is usually discolored and sometimes bloody. Depending on the location of the infection, certain symptoms are more likely to develop. When the infection settles in the air passages, cough and sputum tend to predominate the symptoms. In some, the spongy tissue of the lungs that contain the air sacs is more involved. In this case, oxygenation of the blood can be impaired, along with stiffening of the lung, which results in shortness of breath. At times, the individual\\'s skin color may change and become dusky or purplish (a condition known as \"cyanosis\") due to their blood being poorly oxygenated. The only pain fibers in the lung are on the surface of the lung, in the area known as the pleura. Chest pain may develop if the outer aspects of the lung close to the pleura are involved in the infection. This pain is usually sharp and worsens when taking a deep breath and is known as pleuritic pain or pleurisy. In other cases of pneumonia, depending on the causative organism, there can be a slow onset of symptoms. A worsening cough, headaches, and muscle aches may be the only symptoms. Children and babies who develop pneumonia often do not have any specific signs of a chest infection but develop a fever, appear quite ill, and can become lethargic.

Antibiotics can cure bacterial pneumonia and make recovery from mycoplasma pneumonia much quicker.

Young, healthy people can feel perfectly fine only a week after recovery from pneumonia. A middle-aged person may not regain full strength for several weeks. In all cases, plenty of rest is needed.

I wouldn\\'t assume your testosterone levels are low just because you\\'re having an issue with your sex drive. Unfortunately, there are a lot of so-called \"male enhancement\" products out there that claim to help with erectile dysfunction and low testosterone, but these products may not have any scientific backing -- and some have been shown to illegally contain prescription medications. To be clear, the only thing that can raise testosterone levels is testosterone replacement therapy (like a prescription gel), and you can only get that from a health care provider. Erectile dysfunction (not being able to get an erection or only being able to get a poor quality erection) can be a sign of a larger health issue. If you\\'re experiencing problems getting an erection, I would encourage you to see a health care provider for an evaluation. Even without health insurance, you may be able to be seen at a free or low-cost clinic. You can get information about low-cost health services by calling a local hospital or even your city\\'s information office. Best wishes to you!

The first question is: How did you take your daughter\\'s ? Is it an oral temperature? Armpit? Ear? Forehead? Each of these methods produces a different \"normal\" temperature range. For example, we expect to see a temperature around 98.6 with an oral reading, but an armpit temp will be lower than that. A rectal or ear (tympanic) temperature may be higher than 98.6. Secondly, if you took your daughter\\'s temperature orally, did you do so shortly after she\\'d had something cool or cold to drink? If so, this can lower the thermometer reading significantly. An oral reading should be taken at least 20 minutes after eating or drinking anything. Try taking a second reading to see if the number changes. If you\\'re taking an oral reading, be sure to do it properly. Have your daughter lift her tongue, then place the tip of the thermometer well under your daughter\\'s tongue, up against the midline \"frenulum\" (the tissue that divides the underside of the tongue). Have your daughter gently close her mouth while you hold onto the thermometer in order to keep the probe well-seated under the tongue. The thermometer should stay at about a 45-degree angle. Third, are you sure the thermometer is accurate? Cleanse the thermometer and take someone else\\'s temperature. Do you get a relatively accurate reading?

They evolved over the centuries as different yogis developed their own philosophies and approaches and taught them to eager students, who then passed them on to their own students and disciples. Some of the most popular in the U.S., and the ones you are most likely to find in yoga and fitness centers, are Hatha, Iyengar, Astanga (or Ashtanga), Bikram, and Kundalini. Your local center may teach other types, and so you should contact the center if you are curious. Heres a brief description of the most popular types of yoga in the U.S.: Hatha yoga is the most widely practiced type in the U.S. and is excellent for beginners. It is gentle with slow and smooth movements, and the focus is on holding the poses and integrating your breathing into the movement. It\\'s a great introduction to yoga as it incorporates many different asanas, as well as pranayamas and chanting. Hatha yoga will prepare you for other yoga types that might be taught at your yoga center. Hatha is a great way to stretch, work your muscles, get in touch with your body, relax, and decrease stress. Iyengar yoga is a form of yoga that uses poses similar to Hatha, but it focuses more on body alignment and balance, holding poses longer, and using props such as straps, blankets, and blocks. It\\'s also a good choice for beginners. Kundalini yoga emphasizes rapid movement through the poses and emphasizes breathing, chanting, and meditation. It has a more spiritual feel than Hatha and focuses on energy balance in your body. You might find Kundalini physically and mentally challenging if you\\'re a beginner and unfamiliar with yoga poses, chanting, and meditation, and so Hatha or any beginner class is probably a better way to go. Bikram yoga is practiced in a room (sometimes unventilated) heated to about 105 degrees Fahrenheit. The objective is to loosen muscles and to sweat to cleanse the body and remove symptoms of disease and chronic pain. Some yoga teachers don\\'t recommend it because of the potential risk of dehydration, blood pressure changes, and cardiac problems with exertion in such an inhospitable environment. This is particularly so for individuals who may have an existing heart problem or high blood pressure but don\\'t know it. But Bikram has grown in popularity, and some people swear by it. Speak with your physician first if you are determined to try it. Ashtanga yoga , or power yoga, is an ancient system of yoga taught by Sri K. Pattabhi Jois at the Ashtanga Yoga Research Institute in Mysore, India. In the U.S., it is taught as an aggressive workout where you move quickly from one pose to another to build strength and endurance. There is little emphasis on meditation with Ashtanga, and at the end of the session you will feel more like you have completed a traditional weight-training or callisthenic workout than you would with any other type of yoga. Ashtanga is for you if you\\'re looking for a tough, physically challenging workout.

Start your day with an extra boost of vitamin C (not just from orange juice) by tossing broccoli into your breakfast scramble or omelet. Add it to your lunch by finely chopping it and stir into soup or toss in a salad, raw. Break out of the steamed box at dinner and change up the side dish by roasting broccoli in the oven. The trick is to use a high heat (450 degrees) for 5-7 minutes. First, slice a head of broccoli into quarter-inch to half-inch pieces. Spread them out on a sheet pan, drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and splash with soy sauce and sesame seeds. Another variation is to drizzle with extra virgin olive oil, sea salt and fresh chopped herbs. Finally, try adding a minced shallot, and a dash of sea salt and red pepper chili flakes. Again, all of these variations are completed within 5-7 minutes in a hot oven. And, you can use this method with many different vegetables, including Swiss chard, kale, cauliflower and asparagus. My shortcut when Im teaching classes is: Olive oil, salt, pepper, heat. Its an easy way to remember a great tip on preparing delicious veggies quickly. I havent come up with any broccoli desserts, but if I get inspired, I will let you know! You will not hear me advocating for you to sneak them into a brownie or cake  I am passionately convinced that if you make a vegetable delicious and not overcooked, you will never need to hide or sneak them into your meals!

She is a busy, working mom who loves to feed her family well but, like many of us, had a busy working mom herself and lost many of the tips, tricks and recipes that were passed down from generation to generation. This week she brought up the green bean dilemma. What do I do with these things?! And, by the way, I am referring to fresh green beans. (I highly advise you to avoid the canned ones at all costs Ill explain more on that later.) How to cook them? How long? Blanching the beans is the best way to have them retain their color. That means cooking them in a pot of salted boiling water, removing them and cooling them quickly in a bowl of ice water. At this point you can save them for later (put in a ziploc bag and store in refrigerator for up to 5 days) or use them in a salad or saut them with a bit of garlic, extra virgin olive oil and a favorite herb. If you will be using your beans in a salad, cook them until they are done all the way through (but not mushy) and then put them in the ice bath. You can skip the blanching step but you will lose the bright green color and firm texture that I believe makes for a better dish. Green beans are one of the only beans that can be eaten in their whole, fresh form. Most beans are utilized only for the seeds on the inside and need to be dried. Green beans are a fantastic side dish with roast chicken, steak or fish. Theyre also fantastic cut into one-inch lengths and added to soups and stews. I love them with hot peppers, basil and soy sauce which give them an Asian flair. I find the canned variety of beans a food tragedy. What starts out as a vibrant vegetable, packed with color, flavor and nutrients gets cooked down to a green, mushy and bland piece of adult-style baby food. The beans in the can are so overcooked that the flavor and nutrients have been leached out. If you keep them in their more natural state (cooking for 5-15 minutes depending on the size or variety vs. the 45-plus minutes of overcooked beans), you will enjoy them. They earn their nickname, the green giant. The variety that is seasonal in the U.S. in summer and fall is full of vitamins A, C, K and zinc, iron and beta carotene. Add green beans to your weekly food menu, and you and your family will be well on your way to a healthy and delicious meal.

About 10% of people develop what are called large local reactions. This is an ongoing reaction to the sting with a large area of inflamed, painful, swollen skin. The reaction and its symptoms can continue to get worse for 48 hours and take up to 10 days to resolve. Call your doctor if symptoms are still getting worse a few hours after a sting, or if the reaction looks alarming. Prescription anti-inflammatory medicines like prednisone and topical steroids may help. At home, cold compresses and over-the-counter pain medicines can also be used. The worst reaction to a bee sting is called a systemic allergic reaction, or anaphylaxis. This is a whole-body, life-threatening reaction to insect venom. It doesnt occur often, but when it does, people often underestimate the seriousness of the symptoms:  Itching or rash in areas of skin away from the sting.  Hoarseness or shortness of breath.  Lightheadedness. People can develop anaphylaxis even without a previous serious reaction to bee stings. If you have any of these symptoms of anaphylaxis after an insect sting, seek immediate medical attention or call 911.

Bacteria that cause gastroenteritis include Escherichia coli, salmonella, Campylobacter, and Shigella. These bacteria are usually found in food, but can be spread person to person, says David Burkhart, MD, a staff physician at the Indiana University Health Center in Bloomington. Viruses that trigger gastroenteritis include adenoviruses, rotaviruses, calciviruses, astroviruses, and norovirus. Certain viruses are found in specific places, Burkhart says. For instance, norovirus often shows up on college campuses, lingering on doorknobs and shared keyboards, spreading the gastroenteritis among students. Parasites and protozoans that commonly lead to gastroenteritis include Giardia and cryptosporidium. The parasite Giardia lives in the intestines of infected people or animals, and often spreads when someone swallows polluted water. Chemical toxins in seafood can also cause gastroenteritis, so can exposure to heavy metals, such as lead in drinking water. Other causes of non-contagious gastroenteritis include food allergies, caffeine, or medications such as antibiotics, steroids, aspirin, and laxatives.

Eye of round, London broil, New York, flank, filet mignon  they all stand before you, and it can be overwhelming. My cousin Celia called me today. She was having that What to do with the meat? dilemma. She was getting ready for a friends birthday party (this friend LOVES a great steak), but wasnt sure which cut to pick for the crowd. If youre having a group of people and plan to serve filet mignon, it can be a costly endeavor. My favorite cut of meat when entertaining and working on a budget is London Broil. It is not a fatty cut. The thing you need to be careful about is cutting it correctly so its not chewy. When you are starting, make sure to wait until the meat is room temperature  do not start cooking it right out of the refrigerator. If your meat is too cold when you start cooking it, it will end up being dried out and chewy. I recommend using an oven or grill on high heat and dont cook the steak too long (I recommend medium rare to medium at the most). You can vary your presentation and flavors greatly. I also recommend that after you cook a piece of meat that is 1-2 pounds, slice it thin. This way, you end up eating a smaller portion of meat. You still get your boost of protein and iron  and not by overdoing it on a 20-ounce ribeye! You can rub a London Broil piece down with cracked pepper, kosher salt and extra virgin olive oil. Throw it on the grill and then finish it with chopped fresh rosemary and some sauted garlic. You can also serve the sliced beef on a bed of arugula and heirloom tomatoes that are drizzled with a bit of extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Anyway you prepare it, have fun with it, and remember to keep your portion size in mind. A good visual for portion size is the size of your fist.

The hemorrhoidal veins are located in the lowest area of the rectum and the anus. Sometimes they swell so that the vein walls become stretched, thin, and irritated by passing bowel movements. Hemorrhoids are classified into two general categories: internal and external. Internal hemorrhoids lie far enough inside the rectum that you can\\'t see or feel them. They don\\'t usually hurt because there are few pain-sensing nerves in the rectum. Bleeding may be the only sign that they are there. Sometimes internal hemorrhoids prolapse, or enlarge and protrude outside the anal sphincter. If so, you may be able to see or feel them as moist, pink pads of skin that are pinker than the surrounding area. Prolapsed hemorrhoids may hurt because the anus is dense with pain-sensing nerves. They usually recede into the rectum on their own; if they don\\'t, they can be gently pushed back into place. External hemorrhoids lie within the anus and are usually painful. If an external hemorrhoid prolapses to the outside (usually in the course of passing a stool), you can see and feel it. Blood clots sometimes form within prolapsed external hemorrhoids, causing an extremely painful condition called a thrombosis. If an external hemorrhoid becomes thrombosed, it can look rather frightening, turning purple or blue, and could possibly bleed. Despite their appearance, thrombosed hemorrhoids are usually not serious and will resolve themselves in about a week. If the pain is unbearable, your doctor can remove the thrombosed hemorrhoid, which stops the pain, during an office visit. Anal bleeding and pain of any sort is alarming and should be evaluated; it can indicate a life-threatening condition, such as colorectal cancer. Hemorrhoids are the No. 1 cause of anal bleeding and are rarely dangerous, but a definite diagnosis from your doctor is a must.

They can get better, however, so that living with them is tolerable. Both conventional and alternative practitioners consider diet the best treatment for hemorrhoids. A diet rich in high-fiber foods and low in processed foods is essential. Increasing fluid intake to six to eight eight-ounce glasses a day also is important. Probably half of all hemorrhoid sufferers find relief with dietary changes alone. Most hemorrhoid treatments aim to minimize pain and itching. Warm (but not hot) sitz baths are the most time-honored and oft-suggested therapy: Sit in about three inches of warm water for 15 minutes, several times a day, especially after a bowel movement. If you are pregnant, discuss any treatment, including dietary changes, with your doctor before proceeding. If you have been diagnosed with hemorrhoids, a high-fiber diet combined with sitz baths and acetaminophen should reduce discomfort within two weeks. If symptoms persist, your physician may suggest one of the following procedures. Many can be performed in your doctor\\'s office. Injection . An internal hemorrhoid can be injected with a solution which creates a scar and closes off the hemorrhoid. The injection hurts only a little, as any injection does. Banding . Prolapsed hemorrhoids are often removed using rubber-band ligation. A special tool secures a tiny rubber band around the hemorrhoid, shutting off its blood supply almost instantly. Within a week, the hemorrhoid shrivels and falls off. Coagulation or cauterization . Using either an electric probe, a laser beam, or an infrared light, a tiny burn painlessly seals the end of the hemorrhoid, causing it to close off and shrink. This is most useful for prolapsed hemorrhoids. Surgery . For large internal hemorrhoids or extremely uncomfortable external hemorrhoids (such as thrombosed hemorrhoids that are too painful to live with), your doctor may elect traditional surgery, called hemorrhoidectomy. The success rate for hemorrhoid removal approaches 95%, but unless dietary and lifestyle changes are made, hemorrhoids may recur.

I spent a lot of time in that nurses office, and apparently so did many of the students. All day long, it was a dance of complaints. Since the nurses professional hands are often tied when it comes to treatment, the most common disposition for a sick child is a trip home. Next to tummy aches, headaches were at the top of the whine list. When I think back to my own middle school days, there were plenty of things that can lead to headaches. Just being at school all day is a headache to some kids. Fortunately for all of us, most headaches are not brain tumors or aneurysms. In healthy, active kids, the most common type of headache that is seen is the classic muscle-tension headache. The brain itself does not feel pain, but all of the sensitive nerves, muscles and blood vessels of our head can certainly generate a doozie of a headache. Dont get me wrong; headaches can be hallmarks of something more serious, but most of the time, a random, self-limiting headache is just that a headache. Headaches are in the body of the beholder. A medical provider cannot see a headache, which makes this an ideal get-out-of-school reason. Teenagers tend to be great actors and are able to give a command performance at will. Some performances are so good they end up in my office. By the time I see them, parents are worried about brain tumors, meningitis and all types of horrible diagnoses. On a one to 10 scale, with 10 being the worst headache, what number do you give your headache? If a comfortable-looking person tells me nine, and their mannerism looks more like a one or two, I am suspicious. I will then inquire as to the frequency of headaches, their location on the head, factors that may bring on the headache, and things the person does to make the headache better. The number of missed days from school is another important bit of information. I think its a migraine. Most people dont have a clue what migraine really means, but will frequently self-diagnose. Most feel that the word migraine just indicates a bad headache. When I explain to them that a migraine is a certain type of vascular (blood vessel) headache that usually occurs on just one side of the head, usually severe, accompanied by nausea\/vomiting, and proceeded by an aura (a feeling that a headache is imminent, such as blurry\/wavy vision), they will usually admit they do not have these things. Migraines tend to run in families, and in women, may be cyclic, related to menstruation. Among many other triggers, hormonal contraceptives can also trigger migraines in some people. Younger children do a lot behavioral modeling. They see a parent constantly complaining of headaches, and they may get one, too. Headaches located at the back of the neck or upper shoulders, radiating to the scalp, and feeling like your head is in a vise, are usually muscle tension headaches. These can be due to sleeping on several thick pillows (flexing the neck), or sitting like a slug in those uncomfortable school desks. Nervous tension, like algebra tests, or the day they need to run a mile in physical education, all can create tension headaches. On examination, I can usually find a very sore area (trigger point) around the nape of the neck, and of course, no clinical findings suggestive of brain tumors. Parents are relieved; students not so much. Sorting out real headaches from just headache complaints used to avoid something requires a lot of skill and experience. Kids will get headaches when they are worried. Tension at home, like parents arguing, or families going through a divorce will trigger headaches in kids. A physically or emotionally abusive parent will trigger headaches. Bullying at school is another factor. When children are being teased or intimidated by other classmates, they may use headaches as an excuse to go home. Teachers can be bullies, too. When I recall my elementary and middle school days, there were some very unfriendly teachers in my life. Teachers should always be respected but never feared. In dissecting factors that may be triggering a headache, overly demanding (mean) teachers are often high on that list. Rather than just prescribe Tylenol or Motrin, it behooves the clinician and the parent to get more information. Real headaches exist. Serious headaches exist. Even those pseudo-headaches deserve our utmost attention.

These minerals and salts form crystals, which can then join together and form a kidney stone. Kidney stones usually form within the kidney, where urine collects before flowing into the ureter, the tube that leads to the bladder. Small kidney stones are able to pass out of the body in the urine -- and may go completely unnoticed by you. But larger stones irritate and stretch the ureter as they move toward the bladder, blocking the flow of urine and causing excruciating pain. Rarely, a stone can be too large to pass into the ureter and can remain lodged in the kidney, but may still require treatment. Why some people form kidney stones and others don\\'t is not always clear. Kidney stone disease is more common in young and middle-aged adults than in the elderly, and more prevalent in men than women. People living in hot climates are sometimes prone to kidney stones because they may become dehydrated more often than those in cooler climates, which concentrates the minerals in their urine and makes crystal formation easier. Medical evidence suggests that drinking too few fluids can exacerbate this chemical oversaturation of the urine. Most urinary stones are composed of calcium oxalate crystals -- a kind of salt in the urine that\\'s difficult to dissolve. Uric acid, the chemical associated with gout, is a less common cause of stones. If your urine is chronically infected with certain organisms, you can be prone to getting kidney stones of a specific composition as well.

While certain foods may promote stone formation in people who are susceptible, scientists do not believe that eating any specific food causes stones to form in people who are not susceptible. A person with a family history of kidney stones may be more likely to develop stones. Urinary tract infections, kidney disorders such as cystic kidney diseases, and certain metabolic disorders such as hyperparathyroidism are also linked to stone formation. In addition, more than 70 percent of people with a rare hereditary disease called renal tubular acidosis develop kidney stones. Cystinuria and hyperoxaluria are two other rare, inherited metabolic disorders that often cause kidney stones. In cystinuria, too much of the amino acid cystine, which does not dissolve in urine, is voided, leading to the formation of stones made of cystine. In patients with hyperoxaluria, the body produces too much oxalate, a salt. When the urine contains more oxalate than can be dissolved, the crystals settle out and form stones. Hypercalciuria is inherited, and it may be the cause of stones in more than half of patients. Calcium is absorbed from food in excess and is lost into the urine. This high level of calcium in the urine causes crystals of calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate to form in the kidneys or elsewhere in the urinary tract. Other causes of kidney stones are hyperuricosuria, which is a disorder of uric acid metabolism; gout; excess intake of vitamin D; urinary tract infections; and blockage of the urinary tract. Certain diuretics, commonly called water pills, and calcium-based antacids may increase the risk of forming kidney stones by increasing the amount of calcium in the urine. Calcium oxalate stones may also form in people who have chronic inflammation of the bowel or who have had an intestinal bypass operation, or ostomy surgery. As mentioned earlier, struvite stones can form in people who have had a urinary tract infection. People who take the protease inhibitor indinavir, a medicine used to treat HIV infection, may also be at increased risk of developing kidney stones.

I lit a fire while I was making breakfast for my daughter. We talked about how it was the perfect stay-home-and-have-hot-chocolate-watch-a-movie day. My restaurant is closed on Sunday. So, the driving force of my day is to clear my mind free of business stress and enjoy the comforts of home. While zoning out a bit on a reality show about bridal dresses, I let my mind wander to what I should make for dinner tonight. I like to keep our Sunday dinners easy to prepare, comforting, healthy and delicious. On the menu for tonight will be a version of my Tuscan Chicken Soup from Mom-a-licious. I love this soup because it is so satisfying, can be prepared in under 30 minutes and provides leftovers that will last through the week. I am going to take on the more lengthy preparation because I have the extra time today. I will cook a whole, natural chicken to make the broth and the meat for the soup. The smell that fills the house as the stock simmers through the afternoon is pure heaven and aromatherapy that brings about memories of childhood and my grandmother. I boil an entire chicken in a large pot, without cutting or quartering the chicken. I cover the chicken with two inches of water. I bring it to a boil and then turn down to a simmer. I cook mine with cut up onion, carrot, and whole pieces of garlic for extra flavor. I leave it simmering for 1-2 hours depending on the weight of chicken. When the chicken is done, you can pour all the broth through a strainer. Let the chicken cool for a few minutes. If you prefer, put on kitchen gloves and pull the meat off the bones (it comes off very easily) and discard the skin and bones of the chicken. After the broth is done I will add the pulled chicken, rinsed, canned Italian white beans and kidney beans, (you can add any type you like), and a can of crushed organic tomatoes. Fresh basil and dill will be added. Ill stir in finely chopped carrot and celery toward the end (so it retains a bit of a crunch). Then Ill serve it with freshly grated Parmesan cheese and warm bread. Im going to go curl up on the couch with a good book and my daughter, wait for the approaching dinner hour, and smell the delicious aromas that promise a hearty, healthy dinner.

You can minimize your chances of developing an infection by modifying your diet. If you have a mild case of diverticulosis, your doctor may have you eat a high-fiber diet to make sure your bowels move regularly and to reduce your odds of getting diverticulitis. If you develop diverticulitis you need to see a doctor to make sure you recover completely and to avoid possible life-threatening complications. Diverticulitis is treated using diet modifications, antibiotics, and possibly surgery. Mild diverticulitis infection may be treated with bed rest, stool softeners, a liquid diet, antibiotics to fight the inflammation, and possibly antispasmodic drugs. However, if you have had a perforation or develop a more severe infection you will probably be hospitalized so you can receive intravenous (through a vein) antibiotics. You may also be fed intravenously to give your colon time to recuperate. In addition, your doctor may want to drain infected abscesses and give your intestinal tract a rest by performing a temporary colostomy. A colostomy creates an opening (called a stoma) so your intestine will empty into a bag that is attached to the front of your abdomen. Depending on the success of your recovery, this procedure may be reversed during a second operation. If you have several attacks of acute diverticulitis, your doctor may want to remove the affected section of the intestine when you are free of symptoms. You may also need surgery if intravenous therapy does not effectively treat your acute attack of diverticulitis. Whatever your treatment, your chances for a full recovery are very good if you receive prompt medical attention. You should drink at least eight 8-ounce glasses of water daily to prevent constipation. If you do become constipated, prunes or prune juice may serve as natural laxatives. Follow a low-fat diet; fat slows down the passage of food through the intestine. Get yourself tested for food allergies to identify foods that irritate your system so that you can avoid them. During acute attacks of diverticulitis, eat low-bulk foods (broths and low-fiber breads) while diverticula are inflamed and sensitive, and make the following foods a significant part of your diet: cooked vegetables, cooked fruits, and apples -- all of which will be soothing to the inflamed intestine. Avoid milk and milk products (yogurts and cheeses), which could worsen your illness, especially if you have diarrhea.

Eating a diet low in fiber and high in refined foods can greatly increase your risk. Indeed, in Western societies, an estimated 10% of people over 40 eventually develop diverticulosis; the figure reaches 50% in people over 60. Diverticulitis will occur in about 10%-25% of those with diverticulosis. Though it has not been proven, it is thought that if you are often constipated and usually strain when you have a bowel movement, you may create enough pressure in the intestinal walls to weaken them and begin the development of diverticular pouches. If the diverticula then become filled with fecal material or with undigested food, they are vulnerable to bacterial infection and may result in diverticulitis. If you think you have either diverticulosis or diverticulitis, talk to your doctor. Your doctor can perform tests to diagnose the conditions including: Barium enema , a test in which the colon is filled with barium before an X-ray is taken to show an outline of the inside of the intestines. Colonoscopy , a test in which a flexible lighted tube is used to examine the inside of your intestines. If you have an acute case of diverticulitis, a barium enema and colonoscopy can injure your intestine. Instead, your doctor may recommend a CT scan, which can help confirm the diagnosis of diverticulitis.

Deciding to have no treatment is always a reasonable option if the growths are not bothersome. If the tags are bothersome, multiple home and medical options are available: Tie off tag at narrow base with a piece of dental floss or string. Freeze tag with liquid nitrogen. Burn tag using electric cautery or Hyfrecator. Remove tag with scissors, with or without anesthetic. There are several effective medical ways to remove a skin tag, including removing with scissors, freezing (using liquid nitrogen), and burning (using medical electric cautery at the physician\\'s office). Usually small tags may be removed easily without anesthesia while larger growths may require some local anesthesia (injected lidocaine) prior to removal. Application of a topical anesthesia cream (Betacaine cream or LMX 5% cream) prior to the procedure may be desirable in areas where there are a large number of tags. Dermatologists (skin specialist doctors), family physicians, and internal medicine physicians are the doctors who treat tags most often. Occasionally, an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) is needed to remove tags very close to the eyelid margin. There are also home remedies and self-treatments, including tying off the small tag stalk with a piece of thread or dental floss and allowing the tag to fall off over several days. The advantage of scissor removal is that the growth is immediately removed and there are instant results. The potential disadvantage of any kind of scissor or minor surgical procedure to remove tags is minor bleeding. Possible risks with freezing or burning include temporary skin discoloration, need for repeat treatment(s), and failure for the tag to fall off. There is no evidence that removing tags causes more tags to grow. Rather, there are some people who may be more prone to developing skin tags and may have new growths periodically. Some patients even require periodic removal of tags at annual or quarterly intervals.

A doctor may \t\t first ask you questions about your symptoms, such as whether you have a \t\t frequent uncomfortable feeling of burning, warmth, heat, or pain just behind \t\t the breastbone, a feeling commonly referred to as heartburn . If you have \t\t frequent, severe episodes of heartburn, your doctor may prescribe medicines \t\t normally used to treat symptoms of GERD without performing any other tests. If \t\t your symptoms get better with these medicines, your doctor will usually \t\t diagnose you as having GERD . Depending on your symptoms, your \t\t doctor may refer you to a specialist (such as a \t\t gastroenterologist ) for a test called an \t\t upper gastrointestinal endoscopy . This allows your \t\t doctor to look at the inner lining of your \t\t esophagus , stomach , and the first part of your small \t\t intestine ( duodenum ) through a thin, flexible viewing instrument \t\t called an endoscope. Endoscopy is \t\t used to: Look for problems in people who have symptoms of GERD and also \t\t\t trouble swallowing (dysphagia). Look for other causes of your \t\t\t symptoms if medicines have not helped. Sometimes endoscopy is normal but you \t\t\t still have symptoms that don\\'t get better with medicine. If so, \t\t\t esophageal tests may be done. This testing includes: \t\t\t Manometry testing, which determines how well \t\t\t\tmuscles in the esophagus move food into the stomach and how tightly the valve \t\t\t\tbetween the esophagus and stomach (the lower esophageal sphincter) closes. \t\t\t\tManometry testing is also often required before doing surgery to treat \t\t\t\tGERD. pH monitoring, which tests how often acid from the stomach \t\t\t\tgets into the esophagus and how long it stays there. X-ray pictures of the esophagus and stomach are not used \t\t\t to diagnose GERD. But they may be useful for detecting other problems that may \t\t\t be causing GERD symptoms, such as a \t\t\t hiatal hernia or a narrowing in the esophagus \t\t\t (stricture). These X-rays may be done as part of a series of tests called an \t\t\t upper gastrointestinal series . The tests your doctor may recommend are based on your \t\t specific GERD symptoms. Before you have more GERD testing , you may want to talk \t\t to your doctor.

Furthermore, some molds produce toxic substances. Mold may not cause health effects, or it may lead to symptoms in people who are sensitive to molds. Allergic reactions to mold are the most common health effects of mold. Allergic reactions may happen immediately or develop after a period of time following exposure. Both growing mold and mold spores may lead to allergic reactions. Symptoms of mold allergy may include sneezing, runny nose, coughing, wheezing, tearing and redness of the eyes, and skin irritation or rash. Asthma attacks may be caused by mold or mold spores in people who have asthma and are allergic to mold. Even in some nonallergic individuals, mold can irritate the eyes, skin, and airways. For example, the \"black mold\" Stachybotrys , along with some other types of mold, produces toxins known as mycotoxins that can cause irritation of the skin and airways in susceptible individuals. In some cases, people may develop severe reactions to mold exposure. Symptoms of severe reactions include fever and difficulty breathing. People with compromised immune systems or those with chronic lung disease can develop serious infections of the lungs due to molds. It is not possible to predict the degree of severity of the health risks associated with mold in the home. Allergic individuals vary in their degree of susceptibility to mold, and the risk may also depend upon the extent and exact type of mold that is present. Despite some initial concerns about other medical conditions, according to the CDC, \"a link between...adverse health effects, such as acute idiopathic pulmonary hemorrhage among infants, memory loss, or lethargy, and molds, including the mold Stachybotrys chartarum ( Stachybotrys atra ), has not been proven.\" ","votes":"177","membertype":"Expert","helpful":"144","title":"What kinds of health problems may be linked to mold?

That\\'s a trait to encourage! However, I think he\\'s confusing several different issues here. Let me see if I can briefly untangle this for you. First, I know of no studies that support a direct connection between grain consumption, in general, and joint disease or damage. Second, there may be some connection between gluten (which is a protein found in wheat grains) and autoimmune diseases, such as (which obviously affects the joints). Again, I don\\'t know of any studies that confirm this, but I do believe the issue is being studied right now. Third, people who have rheumatoid arthritis may be at higher risk of also being diagnosed with , which is an inability to digest gluten. So, I think your son is confusing \"carbohydrates from grains\" with \"gluten,\" and the two terms are not interchangeable. Rice is a grain that does not contain gluten, for example. Importantly, your son needs to know that, at his age especially, he needs to eat a well-balanced diet that includes plenty of complex carbohydrates -- including grains. If he\\'s dead set against eating gluten, I\\'d suggest he switch to brown rice (though recently brown rice was found to contain high levels of arsenic, so he needs to monitor his consumption of this, too). Unless your son suffers from severe digestive problems after eating gluten products (like whole-grain breads, white bread, breakfast cereals, etc.), he probably is at very low risk of developing any joint problems from eating whole grains. If, after this explanation, your son is still concerned, I\\'d suggest he visit his health care provider. He or she can work with your son to develop an eating plan that makes everyone happy -- and keeps your son healthy. Best to you!

The lipids that are commonly measured in blood include various forms of cholesterol, as well as triglycerides. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is the good cholesterol, and higher levels reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is the bad cholesterol, linked to increased risk of heart attacks and strokes. High triglycerides are also a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. In dyslipidemia, the level of one or more of these lipids is abnormal (either too high or too low). Increased activity and a healthy diet should be the first course of treatment for dyslipidemia.

One option for supporting patients either transiently or long-term until the cause of the dysphagia resolves is a feeding tube. The tube for feeding may be passed nasally into the stomach or through the abdominal wall into the stomach or small intestine. Once oral feeding resumes, the tube can be removed. Physical obstruction of the pharynx or esophagus Treatment for obstruction of the pharynx or esophagus requires removal of the obstruction. Tumors usually are removed surgically although occasionally they can be removed endoscopically, totally or partially. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy also may be used particularly for malignant tumors of the pharynx and its surrounding tissues. If malignant tumors of the esophagus cannot be easily removed or the tumor has spread and survival will be limited, swallowing can be improved by placing stents within the esophagus across the area of obstruction. Strictures and Schatzki\\'s rings usually are treated with endoscopic dilation, a procedure in which the narrowed area is stretched either by a long, semi-rigid tube passed through the mouth or a balloon that is blown up inside the esophagus. The most common infiltrating disease causing dysphagia is eosinophilic esophagitis which usually is successfully treated with swallowed corticosteroids. The role of food allergy as a cause of eosinophilic esophagitis is debated; however, there are reports of using elimination diets to identify specific foods that are associated with allergy. Diverticuli of the pharynx and esophagus usually are treated surgically by excising them or by opening them up widely to the esophagus so that food does not collect in them. Occasionally they can be treated endoscopically. Cricopharyngeal bars are treated surgically by cutting the thickened muscle. Osteophytes also can be removed surgically. Congenital abnormalities of the esophagus usually are treated surgically soon after birth so that oral feeding can resume. Diseases of the brain As previously discussed, strokes are the most common disease of the brain to cause dysphagia. Dysphagia usually is at its worst immediately after the stroke, and often the dysphagia improves with time and even may disappear. If it does not disappear, swallowing is evaluated, usually with a video swallowing study. Tumors of the brain can be removed surgically; however, it is unlikely that surgery will reverse the dysphagia. Parkinson\\'s disease and multiple sclerosis can be treated with drugs and may be useful in patients with dysphagia. Diseases of smooth muscle of the esophagus Achalasia is treated like a stricture of the esophagus with dilation, usually with a balloon. A second option is surgical treatment in which the muscle of the lower esophageal sphincter is cut (a myotomy) in order to reduce the pressure and obstruction caused by the non-relaxing sphincter. Drugs that relax the sphincter usually have little or a transient effect and are useful only when achalasia is mild. An option for individuals who are at high risk for surgery or balloon dilation is injection of botulinin toxin into the sphincter. The toxin damages the muscle of the sphincter and causes the pressure within the sphincter to decrease. In other spastic motility disorders, several drugs may be tried, including anti-cholinergic medications, peppermint, nitroglycerin, and calcium channel blockers, but the effectiveness of these drugs is not clear and studies with them are nonexistent or limited. For patients with severe and uncontrollable symptoms of pain and\/or dysphagia, a surgical procedure called a long myotomy occasionally is performed. A long myotomy is similar to the surgical treatment for achalasia but the cut in the muscle is extended up along the body of the esophagus for a variable distance in an attempt to reduce pressures and obstruction to the bolus. There is no treatment for ineffective peristalsis, and individuals must change their eating habits. Diseases of the skeletal muscle of the pharynx There are effective drug therapies for polymyositis and myasthenia gravis that should also improve associated dysphagia. Corticosteroids and drugs that suppress immunity sometimes are used to treat some of the muscular dystrophies, but their effectiveness has not been demonstrated. There is no treatment for the metabolic myopathies other than changes in lifestyle and diet. Miscellaneous diseases Diseases that reduce the production of saliva can be treated with artificial saliva or over-the-counter and prescription drugs that stimulate the production of saliva.

They may experience a little more side-effects and it\\'s just the way the drug is released. So the patient may need to be switched back to the brand medication, such as Wellbutrin. Lexapro there currently is no generic, so Lexapro will be at brands. But we are finding out so much more that how I take a pill and how you take a pill might be completely different. It may help you, it may not help me necessarily. So antidepressant therapy is becoming a category that therapy needs to be individualized based on the patient.

Usually, you have to take it for a few weeks before you see any improvements.

As liver cells give way to tough scar tissue, the organ loses its ability to function properly. Severe damage can lead to liver failure and possibly death. Cirrhosis poses another danger as well: Dense scarring slows the normal flow of blood through the liver, causing blood to find alternate pathways to return to the heart. This includes veins along the stomach and esophagus. The added pressure in these blood vessels, called varices can cause them to enlarge and, in some cases, rupture. This is especially a problem for the blood vessels in the esophagus. Every year, about 29,000 people in the U.S. die from cirrhosis, mainly due to alcoholic liver disease and chronic hepatitis C. The disease cannot be reversed or cured except, in some cases, through a liver transplant.

Cirrhosis of the liver generally shortens life expectancy sometimes greatly. There are 4 stages of liver cirrhosis.

These positive changes may include improved dietary habits and drinking cessation. The tricks to living a longer life with this disease include early diagnosis and arresting the amount of liver damage thereby maintaining maximum remaining liver function. Physicians use a relatively simple formula to determine life expectancy for individuals afflicted with this disease. Five different factors including liver enzyme testing (e.g. Bilirubin), fluid about the liver, and hepatic enlargement are rated from 1 (minimal imbalance) to 3 (maximum imbalance). The five numbers are combined for a final score to arrive at a scientific range\" of remaining life expectancy. As you can see, determining life expectancy with liver cirrhosis is a process based upon the stage of development at first discovery, individual scoring of the 5 liver functioning factors, individual commitment to making positive lifestyle changes, and your age and overall general health.

This test may be \t\t\t used to rule out other possible causes of an enlarged or painful testicle \t\t\t before the testicle is removed. Ultrasound is a test that uses reflected sound \t\t\t waves to produce an image of organs and other structures in the body. Unlike \t\t\t many other imaging tests, an ultrasound does not use X-rays or other types of \t\t\t possibly harmful radiation. Blood tests, which are often performed \t\t\t in order to measure the levels of tumor markers in your blood. Tumor markers \t\t\t are substances that appear in your bloodstream when cancer is present.

If the testicular ultrasound and blood tests suggest \t\t testicular cancer, a doctor will surgically remove your affected testicle. This \t\t procedure, called a radical inguinal orchiectomy , is done to confirm a \t\t diagnosis of testicular cancer. Following orchiectomy, a \t\t pathologist will examine tissue from the testicle \t\t under a microscope ( biopsy ). If cancer is found, you may \t\t have other imaging tests to see whether your cancer has spread beyond the \t\t testes. The tests may be \t\t X-rays , \t\t CT scans , or \t\t MRIs of the abdomen, chest, and head.

Sometimes it can be a type of eczema or psoriasis of the nail or some other type of infection. Also, sometimes nail polish removers can leave a yellow discoloration of the toenail.

Frequently recommended treatments include pain and fever medications (such as acetaminophen [Tylenol]), decongestants and mucolytics. Bacterial infection of the sinuses is suspected when facial pain, nasal discharge resembling pus, and symptoms persist for longer than a week and are not responding to OTC nasal medications. Acute sinus infection from bacteria is usually treated with antibiotic therapy aimed at treating the most common bacteria known to cause sinus infection, since it is unusual to be able to get a reliable culture without aspirating the sinuses. The five most common bacteria causing sinus infections are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes. The antibiotics that are effective treatment for sinus infection must be able to kill these bacterial types. Although amoxicillin (Amoxil) is an acceptable first antibiotic for an uncomplicated acute sinus infection, many physicians choose amoxicillin-clavulanate (Augmentin) as the first-line drug for treatment of a suspected bacterial sinus infection because it is usually effective against most of the species and strains of bacteria that cause the disease. In the penicillin allergic individual, cefaclor (Ceclor), loracarbef (Lorabid), clarithromycin (Biaxin), azithromycin (Zithromax), sulfamethoxazole (Gantanol), trimethoprim (Bactrim, Septra) and other antibiotics may be used as first choices. If a patient is not improving after five days of treatment with amoxicillin, the patient may be switched to one of the above drugs or amoxicillin-clavulanate (Augmentin. Generally, an effective antibiotic needs to be continued for a minimum of 10-14 days. It is however not unusual to need to treat sinus infection for 14-21 days. Taking decongestants (pseudoephedrine) and mucolytics (guaifenesin) orally may be helpful in assisting drainage of sinus infection. The treatment of chronic forms of sinus infection requires longer courses of medications, such as Augmentin, and may require a sinus drainage procedure. This drainage typically requires a surgical operation to open the blocked sinus under general anesthesia. In general, antihistamines should be avoided unless it is felt that the sinusitis sinus infection is due to allergy, such as from pollens, dander, or other environmental causes. It is likely that the use of a topical nasal steroid spray will help reduce swelling in the allergic individual without the drying that is caused by using antihistamines although both are occasionally used.

Many of these conditions are reversible with appropriate treatment. Reactions to medications. Medications can sometimes lead to reactions or side effects that mimic dementia. These dementia-like effects can occur in reaction to just one drug or they can result from drug interactions. They may have a rapid onset or they may develop slowly over time. Metabolic problems and endocrine abnormalities. Thyroid problems can lead to apathy, depression, or dementia. Hypoglycemia, a condition in which there is not enough sugar in the bloodstream, can cause confusion or personality changes. Too little or too much sodium or calcium can also trigger mental changes. Some people have an impaired ability to absorb vitamin B12, which creates a condition called pernicious anemia that can cause personality changes, irritability, or depression. Tests can determine if any of these problems are present. Nutritional deficiencies. Deficiencies of thiamine (vitamin B1) frequently result from chronic alcoholism and can seriously impair mental abilities, in particular memories of recent events. Severe deficiency of vitamin B6 can cause a neurological illness called pellagra that may include dementia. Deficiencies of vitamin B12 also have been linked to dementia in some cases. Dehydration can also cause mental impairment that can resemble dementia. Infections. Many infections can cause neurological symptoms, including confusion or delirium, due to fever or other side effects of the body\\'s fight to overcome the infection. Meningitis and encephalitis, which are infections of the brain or the membrane that covers it, can cause confusion, sudden severe dementia, withdrawal from social interaction, impaired judgment, or memory loss. Untreated syphilis also can damage the nervous system and cause dementia. In rare cases, Lyme disease can cause memory or thinking difficulties. People in the advanced stages of AIDS also may develop a form of dementia (see HIV-associated dementia, page 14). People with compromised immune systems, such as those with leukemia and AIDS, may also develop an infection called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML is caused by a common human polyomavirus, JC virus, and leads to damage or destruction of the myelin sheath that covers nerve cells. PML can lead to confusion, difficulty with thinking or speaking, and other mental problems. Subdural hematomas. Subdural hematomas, or bleeding between the brain\\'s surface and its outer covering (the dura), can cause dementia-like symptoms and changes in mental function. Poisoning. Exposure to lead, other heavy metals, or other poisonous substances can lead to symptoms of dementia. These symptoms may or may not resolve after treatment, depending on how badly the brain is damaged. People who have abused substances such as alcohol and recreational drugs sometimes display signs of dementia even after the substance abuse has ended. This condition is known as substance-induced persisting dementia. Brain tumors. In rare cases, people with brain tumors may develop dementia because of damage to their brains. Symptoms may include changes in personality, psychotic episodes, or problems with speech, language, thinking, and memory. Anoxia. Anoxia and a related term, hypoxia, are often used interchangeably to describe a state in which there is a diminished supply of oxygen to an organ\\'s tissues. Anoxia may be caused by many different problems, including heart attack, heart surgery, severe asthma, smoke or carbon monoxide inhalation, high-altitude exposure, strangulation, or an overdose of anesthesia. In severe cases of anoxia the patient may be in a stupor or a coma for periods ranging from hours to days, weeks, or months. Recovery depends on the severity of the oxygen deprivation. As recovery proceeds, a variety of psychological and neurological abnormalities, such as dementia or psychosis, may occur. The person also may experience confusion, personality changes, hallucinations, or memory loss. Heart and lung problems. The brain requires a high level of oxygen in order to carry out its normal functions. Therefore, problems such as chronic lung disease or heart problems that prevent the brain from receiving adequate oxygen can starve brain cells and lead to the symptoms of dementia.

Not recognizing familiar people and \t\t\t places. Having trouble finding the right words to express thoughts \t\t\t or name objects. Having difficulty performing \t\t\t calculations. Having problems planning and carrying out tasks, such \t\t\t as balancing a checkbook, following a recipe, or writing a \t\t\t letter. Having trouble exercising judgment, such as knowing what to \t\t\t do in an emergency. Having difficulty controlling moods or \t\t\t behaviors. \t\t\t Depression is common, and agitation or aggression may \t\t\t occur. Not keeping up personal care such as grooming or \t\t\t bathing. Some types of dementia cause key symptoms: People who have \t\t\t dementia with Lewy bodies often have highly detailed \t\t\t visual hallucinations. They may fall frequently. The first symptoms \t\t\t of \t\t\t frontotemporal dementia may be personality changes or \t\t\t unusual behavior.

The latter option should only be chosen if the restlessness is very disturbing to him.

Write a caption under each picture and his caregivers can use this daily to \\'trigger\\' his memory; you can update this when you visit to perhaps redirect him when you are with him. Silence with a person with dementia can be a meaningful time, too, but you may need to use a calming strategy (for instance music in the background, holding hands for touch).

Boils are skin infections, commonly caused by the bacteria in the family staphylococcus or by other bacteria. The bacteria manage to temporarily evade the bodys defenses and grow in a tightly defined area. Small boils often go away without treatment. In some cases, the skin infection may progress to become an abscess: a lump with a pocket of infected liquid (pus) inside. Touching someones boil, then your own skin, wont necessarily cause a boil to form there. The process by which boils form is more complicated than that. The bacteria may spread to the new persons skin, but never cause a boil. Some people are more susceptible to boils and skin infections than others. One member of the staphylococcus family called MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) causes a large percentage of boils today. MRSA is spread from person to person in close contact. Outbreaks of MRSA have occurred in dormitories, military barracks, athletic facilities, and prisons -- all places where people are in close contact. Good personal hygiene is the most sensible approach to prevent the spread of bacteria that can cause skin infections. Wash your hands with soap and water after touching a boil. A boil can be kept lightly covered with clean gauze. Apply warm-water compresses to help your body clear the infection. If you have a persistent boil or feel you need to squeeze or lance a boil, see a doctor.

They do not seem to have the drive that men have. For us, it is clearly different. In fact, many women describe sex as a chore and they even go out of their way to avoid intimacy until they hit a point when they feel an obligation. No doctor would prescribe medication just to kill your sex drive. If you are depressed or distraught, then they might prescribe a SSRI antidepressant which does in fact often reduce the sex drive for many men.

While sperm can survive for up to 6 days in the female body, eggs survive twelve hours. Therefore, most pregnancies occur when sperm are waiting for the egg. While babies have been conceived with acts of intercourse up to 6 days prior to ovulation, the hightest chance of conception is within the two days prior to ovulation. Learning to interpret your body\\'s signals can help you find your fertility. Cervical mucus. As the egg approaches ovulation, increasing amounts of estrogen are produced and cervical mucus becomes sticky, or stringy like egg whites. Consistency changes as the water content of the mucus increases, making penetration by sperm easier. Cervical mucus changes can be identified up to 6 days prior to ovulation. Timing intercourse when you notice your cervical mucus changing can be effective in helping you to conceive. Ovulation Predictor Kits. OPKs detect luteinizing hormone (LH) or both LH and estradiol. As the egg moves closer to ovulation, estradiol rises. While estradiol rises, LH is released in increasing quantities then drops creating the LH surge that precedes egg release by 24-48 hours. To use an OPK, you urinate on the wick daily and look at the test kit window. With most kits, one line means urine made it into the kit and two lines means LH is detected. Kits that detect both estradiol and LH, read low peak when estradiol only is detected, and high peak when both estradiol and LH is detected. If you are able to detect the surge on the kit, intercourse the day of the surge, and the day after the surge should provide sperm for the arriving egg. Basal Body Tempteratures Once the egg is released, progesterone is produced. Progesterone increases body temperature. Therefore, your temperature goes up after ovulation. The best time to take your temperature is before you get out of bed in the morning. If you chart your temperature daily, you should see at least an 0.3 degree rise in the baseline temperature the day after ovulation. Temperature should stay up until shortly before the period. If you have conceived, your temperature will stay up during pregnancy. Unlike cervical mucus changes, and ovulation predictor kits, basal body temperatures do not let you know that you are about to ovulate. Rather they tell you that you have. So if you want to use them to time intercourse, you need to chart for a month to see when you ovulated and then plan to have intercourse in the cycle days prior to the temperature rise during the next month. Since menstrual cycles can be different from month to month, this method can be frustrating to some. Once you have seen that there is a temperature rise and that your temperature stays up for approximately 2 weeks, you may wish to stop checking daily temperatures to decrease the stress of trying to conceive. If, however, you find the daily temperatures reassuring, feel free to continue. Don\\'t worry. Not all women can detect all of the signs of ovulation. Follow whichever of the signs works for you. If you are unable to detect any of the changes discussed here, you may not be ovulating. See your physician to make the final determination with a blood test for progesterone timed one week after the surge on your OPK or rise in temperature, which should be one week before your period. If you are not ovulating, your physician can try to determine the cause and give you medications to help you release your egg. If the thought of testing for ovulation is frustrating to you, intercourse two to three times a week should cover your fertile window.

But of those that do, of couples that have a hard time conceiving, that present to a fertility doctor, 60 percent of the problems can be related to the female factor, 40 percent to the male. And because male factor fertility can actually be a symptom of something more serious, its not something to be ignored. Testicular cancer often can present as a form of male infertility. Hormonal and metabolic disorders can present as infertility. So when a couple presents to a doctor and is having trouble conceiving, its really essential that the man go to a urologist, get a separate complete exam, blood test, hormone test to be sure that theres not something more serious thats going on. And with a lot of the new advances in sperm aspiration and retrieval and the new assisted reproductive technologies, doctors are just saying, well, it doesnt work, its not great, but we dont need much, all we need is one sperm now and they bypass the evaluation so that the guys and their potential health or metabolic problems are being ignored. You can have congenital absence of the vas that may be a warning sign of cystic fibrosis that you may want to know about if you are having trouble conceiving, so again that can only be found with a good urological exam. So, the moral of this story is, if you and your wife are having problems, um -- Conceiving, then absolutely you should be seen at reproductive specialist on both the female side and a urologist ideally one with reproductive fertility training.

The beginnings of a fertility evaluation focus on eggs, tubes, and sperm. With regards to eggs, your doctor will want to confirm that you are releasing your egg and determine how many eggs remain. Signs that you are releasing an egg are regular, predictable menstrual cycles, positive ovulation predictor kits, shifts in basal body temperature, and\/or a high progesterone level approximately one week before your period. Ovarian reserve, the number of eggs remaining in the ovary, can be evaluated with blood tests (FSH, AMH) and ultrasound for antral follicle count. Fallopian tubes can be evaluated by a hysterosalpingogram, an X-ray test where X-ray dye is injected into the cervix. The X-ray shows the cavity of the uterus and whether the tubes are open. Sperm are evaluated with a semen analysis to look for sperm number and motion. If a semen analysis is not normal, it will be repeated to rule out normal fluctuations. If it is normal either the first or second time, no further evaluation is needed. If it is abnormal twice, you will be referred to urology for further evaluation. The next steps in fertility evaluation and treatment will be based on results to the above tests. While these tests can identify some fertility factors, mother nature is more complex. Occasionally all the tests will be normal, despite a continued delay to pregnancy. Therefore, your doctor will discuss fertility treatment in the context of the evaluation you have completed.

Here are some Rules of the Road when considering integrating yogurt into your nutrition plan. 1) What to Look For on the Label: in a 6 ounce serving, make certain you\\'re getting 100-150 calories; 3.5 grams or less of fat; saturated fat 2.5 grams or less; protein at least 8-10 grams; sugar 20 grams or less; calcium at least 20% RDA; Vitamin D at least 20% of RDA. 2) High Protein Yogurts are Great: The Greek and Icelandic yogurts are concentrated, nonfat or low fat, and have a whopping 16 grams protein per container. If you get them non-flavored, they have less than 10 grams of sugar. I like to add a teaspoon or two of chopped walnuts or sliced almonds, flax seed and blueberries. That makes for a great meal or mid-afternoon snack. 3) Yogurt\\'s Loaded with Vitamins: A single serving provides potassium, phosphorous, riboflavin, iodine, zinc, vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid) and vitamin B12. Vegetarian women are short on B12 which is found mostly in animal products. One eight ounce serving contains 1.4 micrograms of B12, 60% of what adult women need. 4) Yogurt May Help You Shed Pounds: Researchers at the University of Tennessee found that women who ate yogurt a couple of times a day (up to 18 ounces) dropped 22% more weight and 81% more belly fat than women who didn\\'t. Calcium in yogurt helps cells shed the belly weight by preventing stress hormone from packing on the ab fat.

Now we have new data from a report in the Archives of Internal Medicine that found that even if you have a normal overall weight, if youve got excess belly fat and thus a larger than normal waist circumference, you have a much greater chance of dying from any cause over a decade. The researchers looked at 48,500 men and 56,343 women 50 and older who completed questionnaires for the Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort. During the study period, 9,315 men and 5,332 women died. Heres what they found: Men whose waists were 47 inches or larger, and women whose girth exceeded 42 inches, had twice the risk of dying compared to those who had normal-sized waists (less than 40 inches for a man, and less than 35 inches for women). Heres the rub. The BMI (body mass index which should be less than 25) didnt matter. Waist size, not just BMI, is a powerful predictor for death. The bulging belly problem reaches across all ages, but is especially troublesome for men and women over the age of 40. Some studies have noted that over half of men over 50 and 70 percent of women 50+ have larger-than-recommended girths. The study also found that people who had four extra inches around their waist had a 15-25% increased risk of dying. For reasons no one understands, the strongest increase (25%) was in women with larger than normal waistlines and a normal BMI. This means you could be 5 feet 5 inches and weigh 130 pounds with a normal BMI of 21.6, but if your waist size is 35 inches or larger, then your risk of dying increases by 25%. So, normal weight folks out are not out of the woods unless their girth is under control. Heres something everyone needs to be aware of. As you age, and especially if youre sedentary and not physically active on a regular basis, its much easier to lose muscle and replace it with fat. So, dont be fooled into complacency because the scale hasnt changed much. Your waistline has. How does this new information impact on you right now? Here are my thoughts: 1. Measure up. Grab a tape measure and whip it around your belly button. If youre a guy whose girth is 40 inches or greater, or a gal whose belly is 35 or more, listen up. Its irrelevant what your weight and BMI are. You need to get that belly reduced below 40 and 35 inches respectively. 2. Become a waist watcher. Pay attention to your waist measurement over time. In a log book, keep track of your overall weight, BMI, body fat percentage and waist measurement. These numbers will give you a much more accurate assessment of your body composition, as well as risk for future problems. Look at pictures of yourself over time. Its an eye opener for many folks to see the shape shifting that occurs as we age. 3. Mind your belt. Women, get out of your elastic waistbands. You can add 20 pounds and barely know it when you wear those kinds of garments. Instead, get more fitted clothes and belts, which help to keep you connected with your mind and body. Watch out for Muffin Top  belly fat plopping over your waistline. If youve got it, work to remove it. Men, watch out for BOB  belly over belt. 4. Healthy lifestyle habits are the answer. Strive to burn 400 calories everyday by moving around more and adding intensity when you can. Weight lifting is very important as it builds a more powerful calorie-burning engine that will help sustain any weight removal youve achieved. Do it twice per week. Pay more attention to the quality, quantity and frequency of your food consumption. Whole foods please! Watch the portions. Most of you are eating way beyond what you need. End your eating by 8 p.m. each night when you can. And get plenty of sleep. Sleep-deprived folks have larger bellies.

The abdomen is an anatomical area that is bounded by the lower margin of the ribs and diaphragm above, the pelvic bone (pubic ramus) below, and the flanks on each side. Although abdominal pain can arise from the tissues of the abdominal wall that surround the abdominal cavity (such as the skin and abdominal wall muscles), the term abdominal pain generally is used to describe pain originating from organs within the abdominal cavity. Organs of the abdomen include the stomach, small intestine, colon, liver, gallbladder, spleen, and pancreas. Occasionally, pain may be felt in the abdomen even though it is arising from organs that are close to, but not within, the abdominal cavity. For example, conditions of the lower lungs, the kidneys, and the uterus or ovaries can cause abdominal pain. On the other hand, it also is possible for pain from organs within the abdomen to be felt outside of the abdomen. For example, the pain of pancreatic inflammation may be felt in the back. These latter types of pain are called \"referred\" pain because the pain does not originate in the location that it is felt. Rather, the cause of the pain is located away from where it is felt.

You do not say what type of pills that you\\'re considering, but here\\'s my feelings on weight loss pills... I suggest that you talk with your parents about your planned weight loss and together decide on a course of action that is in your best interest. At 15 years old, some teens will thin-out and lose that extra weight naturally over time (waiting for that to occur is difficult). In the meantime, determine what is a desirable weight for your height, age, and body build (there are daily caloric calculators available on the internet to help with this task). Talk with your family doctor before starting any diet and exercise program to ensure that you\\'re taking the steps necessary to safely lose weight. Then you can consider looking for diets and menus on the internet that are satisfying, yummy, and will help you to lose weight at a safe rate of time by consuming fewer calories. The calories should be divided as follows: Protein- 15%, Carbohydrates- 55% , and fats- 30%. Losing 1 pound per week is safe and will result in a 20 pound weight loss within 5 months. By combining some moderate exercise with your diet, youll be at a desirable weight before you know what happened. You may lose weight quicker by reducing your calories to 1400 calories per day and by increasing your exercise routine. To be safe and effective, I recommend not skipping meals or reducing your daily calories below 1300. The internet is loaded with menus that are nutritious, filling, include snacks, and contain varied and delicious foods. Some of these menus even come with a weekly shopping list of necessary food and ingredients along with recipes for the main courses. Dieting can be more fulfilling when shared with another person. See if a friend or family member will join you in your weight loss program. Reward yourself for weight losses by having your hair or nails done. With your doctor\\'s approval, consider incorporating a modest exercise program into your losing weight plan. With exercise, you\\'ll burn additional calories and reach your desired weight goal quicker.

This form initially presents as small red papules similar to insect bites. These lesions rapidly evolve to small blisters and then to pustules that finally scab over with a characteristic honey-colored crust. This entire process takes about one week. These lesions often start around the nose and on the face, but less frequently they may also affect the arms and legs. At times, there may be swollen but non-tender lymph nodes (glands) nearby. Bullous impetigo: This form of impetigo is caused only by Staph bacteria. These bacteria produce a toxin that reduces cell-to-cell stickiness (adhesion) causing separation between the top skin layer (epidermis) and the lower layer (dermis). This leads to the formation of a blister. (The medical term for blister is bulla.) Bullae can appear in various skin areas, especially the buttocks and trunk. These blisters are fragile and contain a clear yellow-colored fluid. The bullae are delicate and often break and leave red, raw skin with a ragged edge.

I have struggled, and struggled, and even though I\\'m on daily meds I still have trouble. This answer is from my own experience and from my heart. People are genetically predisposed to bpd. That means we\\'re born with it, and will die with it. There is no cure. So the first way it affects us over time is that it is a constant \"cross to bear,\" for our entire lives, and we either cope or literally die. Suicide, risky behavior, or pissing off the wrong person during an episode of rage, are some threats to our existence. I have been dangerously near suicide four times - I remember them especially because I was serious. Another way it affects us over time - it\\'s like a failing marriage. Things are ok a lot of the time, but the more and more you argue with the same person about the same thing, the frustration compounds and you would do anything just to make this so-and-so go away. Well, you can get out of a bad marriage. I\\'ve been aware of my disorder for five years now, and I\\'m 35, so this is as far as my experience goes. I don\\'t know how I will be at 40, 50, 60. But from the way it looks now, my strategies will have to change and become more potent if I am to survive. It is LITERALLY a constant battle, except that your sworn enemy and foe is INSIDE YOUR HEAD. And it\\'s SMART. It\\'s similar to our smartphones and apps now, the ones that \"learn\" your search preferences, and even your voice, over time. It finds a way to use your own thoughts against you. For example, if I am going through a mixed manic-depressive episode, I believe (with ALL my heart!) that no one loves me, that I am a failure, that I will never be ok and that I should just take myself out. It is literally temporary insanity! I am a healthy, vibrant, attractive, career-oriented single mother of a beautiful daughter, with a fully loving and supportive family, a therapist who loves me and stays on standby, and I have goals. I am a normal person. But during those times, I am absolutely certain that I am alone, that I will fail at my goals like so many times before, and that I have no reason to go on living. Its the disease. It talks to me in my head and it\\'s hard to differentiate between the sane voice and the insane one, until the episode is over. Then I\\'m perfectly ok. Just like that. Lastly, things that are affected over time are relationships with friends, family and romantic relationships, and jobs. We struggle with dealing with ourselves, so of course others who have to deal with us struggle too. I have had to re-start my career 3 times because I would build up a great rep at a job, and then eventually get fired for emotional instability. So that\\'s where the \"failure\" thoughts come from - how do I know it won\\'t happen again? Just yesterday I couldn\\'t stop crying for four hours AT WORK, even while interacting with my co-workers. I cannot control or guide when or how intense it will be when it hits. Hope this helps!

Episodes of mania and depression typically come back over time. Between episodes, many people with bipolar disorder are free of symptoms, but some people may have lingering symptoms. Doctors usually diagnose mental disorders using guidelines from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , or DSM . According to the DSM , there are four basic types of bipolar disorder: Some people may be diagnosed with rapid-cycling bipolar disorder . This is when a person has four or more episodes of major depression, mania, hypomania, or mixed symptoms within a year. Some people experience more than one episode in a week, or even within one day. Rapid cycling seems to be more common in people who have severe bipolar disorder and may be more common in people who have their first episode at a younger age. One study found that people with rapid cycling had their first episode about four years earlier, during mid to late teen years, than people without rapid cycling bipolar disorder. Rapid cycling affects more women than men. Bipolar disorder tends to worsen if it is not treated. Over time, a person may suffer more frequent and more severe episodes than when the illness first appeared. Also, delays in getting the correct diagnosis and treatment make a person more likely to experience personal, social, and work-related problems. Proper diagnosis and treatment helps people with bipolar disorder lead healthy and productive lives. In most cases, treatment can help reduce the frequency and severity of episodes.

Severe prolapsed bladders that cannot be managed with a pessary usually require surgery to correct them. Prolapsed bladder surgery is usually performed through the vagina, and the goal is to secure the bladder in its correct position. The bladder is repaired with an incision in the vaginal wall. The prolapsed area is closed and the wall is strengthened. Depending on the procedure, surgery can be performed while the woman is under general, regional, or local anesthesia. For smaller surgeries, many women go home the same day of surgery. Various materials have been used to strengthen pelvic weakness associated with prolapsed bladder. The risks of placing mesh through the vagina to repair pelvic organ prolapse may outweigh its benefits, according to the FDA. However, the use of mesh may be appropriate in some situations. A surgeon should explain in detail the risks, benefits, and potential complications of these materials and he or she should explain about the procedure itself before proceeding with the surgery. After surgery, most women can expect to return to a normal level of activity after six weeks. However, surgeons may recommend reducing or eliminating activities that cause straining for up to six months. Do hope this is what you want.

Infection in people is almost unheard of. Scrub typhus is an ongoing problem in Asia and part of Australia. People catch scrub typhus through the bite of a chigger, which injects a tiny mite that carries bacteria that cause the illness. Murine typhus is spread by fleas carried on rats and is present in the U.S. Its possible for outdoor pets (cats and dogs) to encounter those fleas and bring them inside. Murine typhus might occur regularly in Texas and California; the exact rate isnt known. Common symptoms of typhus include: Fever Headache Rapid breathing Muscle aches Rash If untreated, epidemic and scrub typhus can be severe or life-threatening. Murine typhus is almost always mild and goes away on its own; it may go undiagnosed or be misdiagnosed as a viral infection. If you live in the U.S., typhus should be near the bottom of the list of health threats to worry about. Avoiding rats and keeping pets indoors and treated against fleas and ticks should almost eliminate the risk of serious illness. Typhus is usually curable with antibiotics, once it is recognized or suspected. People traveling to parts of Asia where scrub typhus is widespread may benefit from taking antibiotics for prevention.

Everyone feels some discomfort about bringing up this topic. People (especially women) with incontinence problems tend not to bring them up during a routine examination. Unfortunately, some health care professionals don\\'t automatically ask questions about urine leakage, timing, amount and frequency of incontinence episodes. One way for anyone to feel empowered about this difficult topic is to arrive for a medical appointment with some written descriptions about the problem. This can be as simple as a list of symptoms but what I find most useful is a three day bladder diary that details exactly what is going on with a patient. ... In addition, you can answer a standard set of questions in writing and share them during your appointment. This is an easy way to steer the conversation in the right direction. You can say something like, \"I jotted down some items that I want to share with you so I wouldn\\'t forget.\" Here are some standard questions that will help you describe your problem: Do I have strong, sudden urges to urinate? Do I urinate more than 8 times in a 24-hour period? Do I have uncontrollable urges to urinate that sometimes result in wetting accidents? Do I leak urine on the way to the bathroom? Do I leak urine when I laugh or cough or when I participate in active sports? Do I frequently get up two or more times during the night to go to the bathroom? Do I avoid places because I do not know if there is a restroom near by? Do I go to the bathroom so often that it interferes with my activities? Do I frequently limit my fluid intake when I\\'m away from home so that I won\\'t need to worry about finding a restroom? When I\\'m in an unfamiliar place, do I make sure I know where the restroom is? Do I use absorbent pads to keep from wetting my clothes? Remember that you and your doctor or other health care provider (nurse practitioner, physician assistant) are partners in solving your health problems. The better the information about them you share, the more likely you will both be successful. There are many types of solutions for incontinence issues so go to your appointment expecting to control or completely resolve your urinary symptoms.

This is a large expense for a person on a fixed income. Some people are forced to make their own homemade pads from tissue paper, towels and other materials. Unfortunately, Medicare, HMOs and insurance companies don\\'t tend to cover the cost of absorbent products, and their disposal adds to environmental pollution. At the same time, reusable products may not be as \"skin friendly\" as disposable ones. Washable\/reusable products are economical. Studies have shown that some washable pads are equivalent in cost to 100 disposable pads of the same absorbency. Washable underwear is available in basic styles, in styles that mimic regular underwear and in styles that are elegant and indistinguishable from fine lingerie. If you are caring for someone who needs many underwear or pad changes daily, the labor of washing these products is a factor to consider. Incontinence garments (sometimes called adult diapers) that are washable usually have an outer layer of plastic, rubber or synthetic material for protection and can be pulled up, snapped on the side or open down the front. They are usually less expensive to use over time than disposable garments. Because of their waterproof outer layer, many women find washable garments uncomfortable because they don\\'t \"breathe\". Such women often prefer cotton underwear with a perineal pad in the crotch to collect urine leakage.

From my experience, there are no magic bullet answers to incontinence in the elderly patient suffering with dementia. But here are some thoughts and suggestions that may be helpful: - Discuss the incontinence as soon as possible with your mother\\'s doctor and medical care team. The sooner that treatment efforts to improve on incontinency issues occurs, the better the probable outcome. There are medications for example that can help somewhat with urinary urgency. - Ask the doctor or pharmacist to look at your mother\\'s current medications to be certain that they are not contributing to the incontinency. - Have your mother evaluated for possible medical conditions that may be contributing to the problem. Start with the family doctor who can order some preliminary urologic tests,conduct a physical exam, and refer her to a urologist. - Keep a detailed diary of what your mother eats, fluid intake, and eliminates, and share the data with her medical team for feedback. - Determine the times that your mother most frequently becomes incontinent. See if a pattern can be determined and work on a toileting schedule to head off accidents. - Purchase several commodes and strategically place them in different areas of the house for ease of use at the last moment. 2nd hand commodes in clean and good operational condition can be found at thrift stores for a reasonable cost. Many people leaving hospitals use their medical appliances for only a short period of time. A wipe down with soapy water and bleach and they are almost as good as new. - Unopened adult diapers can be expensive. They can also be found in some thrift stores at very reduced costs. - It is important for you to take breaks away from always being the caregiver. See if other family members, friends, or neighbors can give you a needed rest. Incontinency may be part of the mental decline associated with dementia and cause both the patient and caregiver much anxiety. Be aware of becoming frustrated and remove yourself from the situation, if things become too overwhelming. Thank you for being supportive of your mother\\'s needs. I wish you well.

People who abuse alcohol may feel pain and tingling in their arms and legs which is known as neuropathy. Individuals with alcoholic neuropathy suffer damage to the peripheral nerves from their alcohol abuse. The peripheral nerves send signals between the body, the spinal cord and the brain. A contributing factor in nerve damage is the depletion of important nutrients needed for proper nerve function such as vitamins B6, B12 and E, as well as folate, niacin and thiamine. These nutrients are depleted more quickly in individuals with chronic and excessive alcohol abuse. The peripheral nerves help the body manage certain sensory and motor functions such as walking, speech, arm and leg movement, bowel and urinary elimination, and sexual arousal. In persons with alcoholic neuropathy, there is obvious damage to these nerves. Symptoms of alcoholic neuropathy may affect sensation as well as movement and can range from uncomfortable to intense and to the point of disabled. Alcoholic neuropathy can significantly impact the quality of life, but not to the point of being life threatening. Symptoms may include: tingling, numbness\/burning in arms and legs; muscle, spasms, atrophy; constipation\/diarrhea; difficulty urinating; difficulty swallowing; vomiting\/nausea and dizziness. You should tell your doctor if you experience any of these symptoms. Early diagnosis and treatment of alcoholic neuropathy increase the chances of recovery. While abstaining from alcohol use can help to restore nutritional health and help to prevent future nerve damage; some alcoholic nerve damage is permanent and cannot be reversed.

Some heart murmurs, called innocent murmurs, occur in completely healthy people. Heart murmurs also can result when the valves of the heart are diseased, creating abnormal blood flow through the valve. People with congenital heart problems (birth defects) or congestive heart failure frequently have heart murmurs. A heart murmur can be a clue to the presence of heart disease.

All of the above can create a \"murmur,\" which is basically just the sound of blood flowing through. There are other less common causes of murmurs, too, that don\\'t involve valves. Sometimes we can make the diagnosis by just listening, and other times we recommend an ultrasound of the heart to visualize the valves and determine if there are any abnormalities. It\\'s not uncommon to hear a murmur, get an ultrasound (also called an echocardiogram), and find that everything looks totally normal and does not require treatment or even follow-up. Your son should talk to his doctor about whether an ultrasound would be appropriate. If he has any symptoms (chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue), then it may be more appropriate to get an echocardiogram.

Because scleroderma can affect the skin, esophagus, blood vessels, kidneys, lungs, blood pressure and bowels, the symptoms it causes can involve many areas of the body. Scleroderma affects the skin to cause local or widespread signs of inflammation (redness, swelling, tenderness, itching, and pain) that can lead to skin tightness or hardening. These skin changes can be widespread, but it\\'s most common for them to affect the fingers, feet, face, and neck. This can lead to decreased range of motion of the fingers, toes, and jaw. Tiny areas of calcification (calcinosis), while not common, can sometimes be noticed as hard nodules at the tips of the elbows or in the fingers. Scleroderma affecting the esophagus leads to heartburn. This is directly a result of stomach acid flowing back up into the esophagus. Sometimes this can lead to scarring of the esophagus, resulting in narrowing with difficulty swallowing food and\/or localized pain in the central chest. Blood vessels that can be affected include the tiny arterioles of the finger tips, toes, and elsewhere. These vessels can have a tendency to spasm when the areas are exposed to cold, leading to blueness, whiteness, and redness of involved fingers, toes, and sometimes nose or ears. These color changes are referred to as Raynaud\\'s phenomenon. Raynaud\\'s phenomenon can cause inadequate supply of oxygen to the involve tips of fingers or toes, causing tiny ulcers or blackened (dead) skin. Sometimes Raynaud\\'s phenomenon is also associated with tingling. Other blood vessels that can be involved in scleroderma are the tiny capillaries of the face, lips, mouth, or fingers. These capillaries widen (dilate), forming tiny, red blanching spots, called telangiectasias. Elevated blood pressure is potentially serious and can lead to kidney damage. Symptoms include headache, fatigue, and in severe cases, stroke. Blood pressure monitoring and control is essential. Inflammation of the lungs in scleroderma can cause scarring, resulting in shortness of breath, especially with physical exertion. Elevated pressure in the arteries to the lungs (pulmonary hypertension) can also cause shortness of breath and difficulty getting an adequate breath with activity. Scleroderma affecting the large bowel (colon) most often causes constipation but can also lead to cramping and diarrhea. When this is severe, complete stool blockage (fecal impaction) can result.

Aggressive treatments of elevations in blood pressure have been extremely important in preventing kidney failure. Blood-pressure medications, particularly the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor class of drugs, such as captopril (Capoten), are frequently used. Recent data indicate that colchicine can be helpful in decreasing the inflammation and tenderness that periodically accompanies the calcinosis nodules in the skin. Skin itching can be relieved with lotions (emollients) such as Eucerin and Lubriderm. Mild Raynaud\\'s phenomenon may require only hand warming and protection. Low-dose aspirin is often added to prevent tiny blood clots in the fingers, especially in patients with a history of fingertip ulcerations. Moderate Raynaud\\'s phenomenon can be helped by medications that open up the arteries, such as nifedipine (Procardia, Adalat) and nicardipine (Cardene), or with topical nitroglycerin applied to the most affected digit (most effective on the sides of the digit where the arteries are). Gently applied finger splinting can protect tender tissues. (It is important to not constrict the tiny arteries on the sides of the fingers when protecting them with splints, braces, or band-aid materials.) A class of medications that is typically used for depression, called serotonin reuptake inhibitors, such as fluoxetine (Prozac), can sometimes improve the circulation of the affected digit. Severe Raynaud\\'s phenomenon can require surgical procedures, such as those to interrupt the nerves of the finger that stimulate constriction of the blood vessels (digital sympathectomy). Ulcerations of the fingers can require topical or oral antibiotics. Esophagus irritation and heartburn can be relieved with omeprazole (Prilosec), esomeprazole (Nexium), or lansoprazole (Prevacid). Antacids can also be helpful. Elevating the head of the bed can reduce the back-flow of acid into the esophagus that causes inflammation and heartburn. Avoiding caffeine and cigarette smoking also helps. Constipation, cramping, and diarrhea is sometimes caused by bacteria that can be treated with tetracycline or erythromycin. Studies have shown that erythromycin could also be used. Increased fluid intake and fiber intake are good general measures. Irritated, itchy dry skin can be helped by emollients such as Lubriderm, Eucerin, Bag Balm histamine 2 blockers, or trazodone (Desyrel). Telangiectasias, such as those on the face, can be treated with local laser therapy. Sun exposure should be minimized as it can worsen telangiectasias. Approximately 10% of patients with the CREST variant develop elevated pressures in the blood vessels to the lungs (pulmonary hypertension). Abnormally elevated blood pressure of the arteries supplying the lungs is often treated with calcium antagonist medications, such as nifedipine (Procardia), and blood-thinning drugs (anticoagulation). More severe pulmonary hypertension can be helped by continuous intravenous infusion or inhalation of prostacyclin (Iloprost). Taken by mouth, bosentan (Tracleer), is now also available to treat pulmonary hypertension. In addition, sildenafil (Viagra) and tadalafil (Cialis) have been FDA approved to treat pulmonary hypertension. Additionally, medications are used to suppress the overly active immune system that seems to be spontaneously causing the disease in organs. Medications used for this purpose include penicillamine, azathioprine (Imuran, Azasan), and methotrexate (Rheumatrex, Trexall). Recent research has found that low-dose penicillamine (Depen, Cuprimine) (125 mg every other day) is as effective as previously used high doses of penicillamine, with less toxicity. Serious inflammation of the lungs (alveolitis) can require immune suppression with cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) along with prednisone (Deltasone, Liquid Pred). The optimal treatment of scleroderma lung disease is an area of active research. Stem-cell transplantation is being explored as a possible option. No medication has been found to be universally effective for all patients with scleroderma. In an individual patient, the illness may be mild and not require treatments. In some, the disease is ravaging and relentless.

They tend to be more common on the face. Sometimes they have some speckled color and often they are identical in color to the surrounding skin. They tend to be slow-growing and unpopular only because of the appearance. There have been some high-profile people that have been very happy to keep their moles on their face. Marilyn Monroe had a mole. So did Cindy Crawford, until recently. Some people report a family history of them, and others report having many of them over the course of their lifetime. Frankly, if one wishes to have the mole removed, it is strictly for cosmetic reasons  unless there has been a change in its appearance, rapid growth suggesting the possibility of malignancy, in which case, it becomes somewhat of a medical dermatologic emergency. For most people, the moles are removed because they just dont like the way they look. If people are walking around with a mole and are not happy with it, often it is because they are afraid to have it removed. There are old wives tales about if you cut into a mole to remove it will grow and spread, suggesting that it would be cancer or malignant. That is just not true. Others are afraid to have it removed because there would be a scar. That is possible if it is not done in the best way, nor in the most experienced hands. Let me tell you about the preferred method, which has served patients very well for many years. In my opinion, the ideal technique to remove one of these moles is to do what is known as a microsurgical shave excision. That is a long medical term for shaving it off the face, using an operating microscope and removing it completely. Incidentally, when that is done at the desire of the patient or suspicion of the doctor it can be sent to a pathologist to be closely examined and make sure there is no malignancy. The microsurgical aspect of it is very important because using an operating microscope, a high-tech magnifying system, the surgeon can clearly see how deep he is going, whether or not there is some residual mole at the base of the wound, and it prevents the surgeon from having to remove, unnecessarily, normal tissue either at the edges or base. In other words, the technology helps the surgeon do a better job by not performing more surgery than necessary. The smaller the wound, the faster and better the healing. With microsurgical shave excision there is no stitching. The minor excavation caused by removal of the mole will heal in by itself, both from the bottom and from the sides, within three to four days if the mole has been on the face, a little longer if on the arms, legs or trunk. The only care required is that the area, which looks like a bit of a scrape, be kept constantly covered with antibiotic ointment and a dressing because if the wound were allowed to dry out, healing would be much slower. Typically, there is a pink color to the fresh skin that has grown in to replace the mole, and that pink color fades within two to three months. So, if you have a typical mole on your face and you dont like it, dont despair, it can be dealt with as an office procedure with rapid healing and ultimately nearly invisible evidence of it ever having been there.

One of the more common effects is the so-called dropped tip. Heres what that means. Initially, when seen from the side, the profile view, the tip sits at a desirable level in relation to the rest of the noses profile. But with time, the tip actually settles down, drops and gives a round or convex appearance to the front half of the profile. It may look like a new bump has formed. There are several reasons why this happens. In most cases, such a drop is predictable  and preventable. The first reason is that the surgeon fails to allow for an anticipated drop and, therefore, incorrectly sets the tip position in reference to the rest of the nasal profile including the bridge. It is well-known among experienced nasal surgeons that there will always be some downward contraction of the tip owing to the fact that their incisions tend to contract. The natural downward pull of gravity and contractile forces from those incisions will tend to make the tip drop. The surgeon must anticipate that during the planning of your operation and during its execution. The second common reason for the tip dropping is that there is not enough strength in the remaining tip cartilage to maintain its position. If the surgeon fails to recognize that the tip cartilage is weak and will not hold its posture after part of it has been removed to narrow the lower half of the nose, then such a dropped tip will occur and the profile will be imperfect. An assessment of the prospects of that happening should take place at the consultation as the surgeon feels the strength of the nasal cartilages and makes an estimate as to what percentage of the strength can be maintained after a portion of the cartilage is removed. Here is the analogy in architecture and construction: If you weaken a load-bearing support wall too much, the roof will sag or come tumbling down. Reason number three for the dropped tip is that, in fact, the tip does not drop but the tissue of the nose above the tip rises up and makes it look like the tip has dropped. This is generally due to the surgeons failure to anticipate the contraction and tightening that will certainly take place during healing. As swelling diminishes and the tissues begin to weld together, an upward elevation of the cartilages in the midportion of the nose can occur. These upper lateral cartilages automatically and naturally migrate toward the middle and if they had not been trimmed enough in anticipation of this migration, then they tend to rise above the anticipated profile level. Thus, a profile convexity occurs that makes the tip look as though it has dropped. An illusion has been created. Rhinoplasty is a complex operation which requires imagination on the part of the surgeon, a working game plan based on anticipated changes and, most importantly, a knowledge of the consequences of each and every surgical maneuver that takes place during the operation. No wonder rhinoplasty holds its reputation as the most difficult operation in the world of cosmetic plastic surgery. And, remember, not all plastic surgeons are equipped by training, experience or talent to perform it.

In the last 25 years, there has been a move toward performing a somewhat contrary procedure known as external rhinoplasty  also known as open rhinoplasty. The difference is that these procedures include, in addition to the standard and necessary internal incisions, a horizontal external incision made across the belly of the columella, which is the vertical bar of tissues that separate the left and right nostrils. Advocates of the open rhinoplasty or external rhinoplasty praise it for the greater exposure or visualization of the front of the nose, particularly the tip cartilages. That is true. It takes a bit more manual dexterity and facility to be able to reach the same point of visibility through the internal incision or closed rhinoplasty approach. It is never quite as satisfactory. However, there are tradeoffs. First, the external incision may not heal perfectly. While we see some people for whom the healing has been optimal and the incision is barely visible, there are others who are unhappy with the appearance; they have a visible scar. Their dissatisfaction is justified. Secondly, each additional incision in rhinoplasty adds some element of unpredictability because of the uncertainty of what we call scar contractile forces. What that means is that as nature heals, it may tighten the tissue more than the surgeon would anticipate, causing a result that is not as expected. Such variance from the ideal can be minimal. However, if it is not, there is dissatisfaction. Frankly, since rhinoplasty was first introduced on a widespread scale over 50 years ago using exclusively the internal rhinoplasty technique, there have been an enormous number of satisfactory procedures performed. Some proponents of the external or open rhinoplasty consider it now to be the standard incision  that somehow, the classic internal or closed rhinoplasty approach is obsolete. I disagree. Many good results can be obtained with internal incisions with less unpredictability. Plus, when done internally, there is no possibility of an unsatisfactory external scar. I do feel that the experienced surgeon should have at his command both techniques. I have used the open rhinoplasty, but very infrequently. I will say that for certain noses, particularly revision rhinoplasty, also known as secondary rhinoplasty cases, the better visualization via the open rhinoplasty can be important since often there was placed at the original surgery either plastic inserts, transplanted cartilage or even bone. The access for dissection and visualization is a bit better under such circumstances. I do want you to understand, however, that the most important thing is that the surgeon who performs the operation delivers consistently good, natural rhinoplasty results. You need to study the cases. You need to look at many before and after pictures. Look carefully for any signs of the external rhinoplasty incision. If a given doctors work evidences too obvious an external incision, he may not have mastered the technique, and therefore, you should be somewhat skeptical of its use by that particular cosmetic plastic surgeon.

Its not just the shape or size of your nose. Its the quality, the material there that is available to work with. For example, thick oily skin tends not to drape down, even though you shave down the bump and narrow the tip, because what you are doing is narrowing the under the surface structures, the bone and the cartilage. But the upholstery, meaning the skin, it does best when its thin and will shrink down uniformly and give a nice contour. So thick skin is a bit of a challenge for us. And oily skin has a greater tendency to have breakouts and all those things that kind of be a bit of a hassle for the patient. And the other question is even the strength of the cartilage, because strong cartilages are really ideal, because you can work with them easier. People that have very soft cartilage, theres a very narrow window in which you can work, because if youre a little over zealous and take out too much, that cartilage is so weak that often the nose will kind of start to collapse and dip down. Youve got to factor all these things into your decision making, but that decision making is done really at the time of consultation. Thats where our most intense thoughts are being hatched, because we have the patient in front of us, we have the ability to feel, to look, size up the situation. We need to look inside the nose and see if theres blockage, because often if you make the nose a little narrower, and the airway isnt so super to begin with, the patient may note afterwards, that gee my breathing isnt quite as good as it was before, whats going on here? So that patient may need to have the discussion about gee, I think we need to open up your air passages a little bit while were there, because after all, the nose is still a functional organ, regardless of how good it looks, if it doesnt work, the patient is not going to be happy.

In other words, if the practitioner is very, very good as determined by your having seen the work done by someone, Im sorry. Lets say that youve determined that the practitioner is quite good because your friend had surgery and your cousin had surgery and his fee is less than someone elses, hey its a no-brainer. But the question is if the work is very good in a doctor who charges more than another doctor, and how much is the difference, and can you quantitate a better practice on the base of cost? Let me tell you, its difficult. Sometimes, theres no rhyme or reason. Some practices are very expensive and yet wouldnt be my pick for practice of the week. And there are others who are really surprisingly very economical. Now, I can tell you why some practices can be very good at what they do and yet not be the high priced leader. It doesnt mean they are the Walmarts, they are not the low priced leader. But the reason is they are very efficient. For example, a surgeon can take an hour to do the same nose job that another takes 3 to 4 hours. Now the doctor that takes 3  4 hours has to charge more for his time. Thats all hes selling. So youre getting probably an inferior service, because if hes a 3 or 4 hour nose job surgeon, hes probably not as skilled as the one hour. He just doesnt have the facility, he doesnt have the experience, doesnt have the efficiency built in, because the operation still has X number of steps. So I would say that the surgeon that is less experienced, and you should be able to glean that by asking how long have you been doing, how many cases, or what percentage of your practice are noses and hes charging more, that doesnt make sense. It doesnt pay to pay more for an amateur. It may pay to pay a little more for the master. And by the way, the difference in cost isnt going to be a factor of two or three. It could be 10% or 15%. In this community here, the range in services from people that I think are very, very good nasal cosmetic surgeons can be from $8,500 to say $10,500, $11,000. Its not going to be $30,000. So again, as a percentage, the span isnt all that great.

Some of the potential general risks of surgery include: bleeding infection scar tissue pain loss of work change in voice problems swallowing failure to cure sleep apnea anesthesia risks (including allergic reaction, stroke, heart attack, and death) other unforeseen surgical complications Surgery should be considered only after all the risks, benefits, and alternatives to surgery are understood. Some insurance companies require a three weeks trial of treatment with CPAP before they will even consider authorizing surgery for sleep apnea. This is not an unreasonable approach. CPAP, if tolerated, controls most sleep apnea, and this is better than all surgical options. It is difficult to have a serious, permanent complication using CPAP as compared to the possible of such a complication with surgery. Any surgical treatment for sleep apnea must address the anatomic problem areas. There may be one or several areas that compromise airflow and cause apnea. Surgical treatments can address the nose, palate, tongue, jaw, neck, obesity, or several of these areas at the same time.

A normal platelet count is between 150,000 and 450,000 platelets per microliter (one-millionth of a liter, abbreviated mcL). The average platelet count is 237,000 per mcL in men and 266,000 per mcL in women. A platelet count below 150,000 per mcL is called thrombocytopenia, while a platelet count over 450,000 is called thrombocytosis. Platelets seem to have a large backup capacity: blood typically still clots normally as long as the platelet count is above 50,000 per mcL (assuming no other problems are present). Spontaneous bleeding doesnt usually occur unless the platelet count falls to 10,000 or 20,000 per mcL. Platelets are constantly being produced in the bone marrow. A low or high platelet count is not often a problem by itself, but can frequently be a sign of another medical condition.

Aspirin and other medicines like clopidogrel (Plavix) interfere with platelets ability to clump together.

The disorder affects both sexes and all races equally; however, it is more noticeable in people with dark skin. Vitiligo seems to be somewhat more common in people with certain autoimmune diseases, including hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid gland), adrenocortical insufficiency (the adrenal gland does not produce enough of the hormone called corticosteroid), alopecia areata (patches of baldness), and pernicious anemia (a low level of red blood cells caused by the failure of the body to absorb vitamin B12). Scientists do not know the reason for the association between vitiligo and these autoimmune diseases. However, most people with vitiligo have no other autoimmune disease. Vitiligo may also be hereditary; that is, it can run in families. Children whose parents have the disorder are more likely to develop vitiligo. In fact, 30 percent of people with vitiligo have a family member with the disease. However, only 5 to 7 percent of children will get vitiligo even if a parent has it, and most people with vitiligo do not have a family history of the disorder.

The first place we start to see vitiligo in most people is around the eyes, around the mouth, and then on areas of high friction, like the hands or even the elbows. So that\\'s what causes it. We know the underlying cause, it\\'s not a mystery. There is no cure for it that we know of, but there are ways to mask it. There are products like Dermablend that you can put on and you can match your own natural skin color to try to conceal it. There are some treatments that we try as dermatologists to help with it. Sometimes using a product called a psoralen, which can be either by mouth or topical. Applied to the skin, you let it incubate for a little while, and then go under ultraviolet light in a light box, can stimulate those pigment forming cells to come back to life and suppress the immune system in the skin in those areas to try to help the pigment come back. Sometimes this works, sometimes it doesn\\'t. When the vitiligo is extensive enough that it covers more of the body than not, so if it\\'s very patchy, if there is a big contrast in skin color, we can use a topical cream called Benoquin to try to eliminate all the pigment forming cells. And take away all the pigments. So sometimes we try to bring the pigment back and sometimes we try to take it all away. But in the meantime, trying to cover it may be the best thing. In rare cases it just fades out on its own. ","votes":"80","membertype":"Expert","helpful":"70","title":"Can vitiligo be cured? What causes it?

Similar patches also appear on both the mucous membranes (tissues that line the inside of the mouth and nose) and the retina (inner layer of the eyeball). The hair that grows on areas affected by vitiligo sometimes turns white. The cause of vitiligo is not known, but doctors and researchers have several different theories. There is strong evidence that people with vitiligo inherit a group of three genes that make them susceptible to depigmentation. The most widely accepted view is that the depigmentation occurs because vitiligo is an autoimmune disease -- a disease in which a person\\'s immune system reacts against the body\\'s own organs or tissues. People\\'s bodies produce proteins called cytokines that, in vitiligo, alter their pigment-producing cells and cause these cells to die. Another theory is that melanocytes destroy themselves. Finally, some people have reported that a single event such as sunburn or emotional distress triggered vitiligo; however, these events have not been scientifically proven as causes of vitiligo.

Just like with any other skill set, its best to practice when you dont have the pressure of needing to be doing it well in that moment. With this in mind, consider the following ABCD approach: Activity: Exercise regularly, and then also do it when you feel your anger building. If you dont already have an exercise routine, explore different types of exercise to find the ones you most enjoy (e.g. jogging, weight lifting, Pilates). Breathing: Deep (or diaphragmatic) breathing can be very helpful in calming down or reducing anxiety. You breathe slowly, taking time to pause at the end of each inhale and exhale. With this kind of breathing, your stomach will inflate like a balloon when you inhale, and deflate when you exhale. Meanwhile, your chest will not expand. If this is difficult for you, try lying on your back with your knees pulled up and your feet flat on the floor. It can also help to place a hand on your stomach to feel its rise on your inhale. Calming activity: Find a hobby or activity that you enjoy and can engage in with your full attention. Examples are gardening, yoga, painting, or playing music. Deepening Understanding  of yourself and the other person: It can be extremely helpful to be aware of what pushes your buttons. By fully understanding this, you can step back and see it happening, which also means that you will not be as caught up in it and can choose to respond differently. So, for instance, you might say to yourself, There I go again. Every time someone even implies that Im not doing a good job, I get furious. It can also be helpful to understand the person triggering your anger. Chances are that they think their actions are valid; so by understanding their perspective (even if you disagree), you might be able to lessen your own anger and even respond in a way that they can respond more positively to.

Opt for lactose-reduced or lactose-free milk and take the enzyme lactase if you eat cheese. Yogurt may not cause any problems if it has active cultures. Beans, broccoli, and cauliflower produce gas, but cooking them longer may reduce the gas later, as may taking an over-the-counter pill (Beano). If you have IBS and are bothered by chronic gas, try eating rice instead of wheat, Kosinski says. If gas results from boosting fiber intake, expect it to level off in a few weeks as your body adjusts. Non-sugar sweeteners can also cause gas, says Harry Aslanian, MD, an associate professor of gastroenterology at the Yale University, School of Medicine in New Haven, Conn.

Gas in the gastrointestinal tract has only two sources. It is either swallowed air or is produced by bacteria that normally inhabit the intestines, primarily the colon. Swallowed air is rarely the cause of excessive flatulence. The usual source is the production of excessive gas by intestinal bacteria. The bacteria produce the gas (hydrogen and\/or methane) when they digest foods, primarily sugars and polysaccharides (for example, starch, cellulose), that have not been digested during passage through the small intestine. The bacteria also produce carbon dioxide, but the carbon dioxide is so rapidly absorbed from the intestine that very little passes in flatus. Sugars Sugars that are commonly poorly digested (maldigested) and malabsorbed are lactose, sorbitol, and fructose. Lactose is the sugar in milk. The absence of the enzyme lactase in the lining of the intestines, which is a genetic trait, causes the maldigestion. Lactase is important because it breaks apart the lactose so that it can be absorbed. Sorbitol is a commonly used sweetener in low-calorie foods. Fructose is a commonly used sweetener in all types of candies and drinks. Starches Starches are another common source of intestinal gas. Starches are polysaccharides that are produced by plants and are composed of long chains of sugars, primarily fructose. Common sources of different types of starch include wheat, oats, potatoes, corn, and rice. Rice is the most easily digested starch and little undigested rice starch reaches the colon and the colonic bacteria. So the consumption of rice produces little gas. In contrast, some of the starches in wheat, oats, potatoes, and, to a lesser extent, corn, all may reach the colon. These starches may result in the production of appreciable amounts of gas. The starch in whole grains produces more gas than the starch in refined (purified) grains. Thus, more gas is formed after eating foods made with whole-wheat flour than with refined wheat flour. This difference in gas production probably occurs because of the fiber present in the whole grain flour. Much of this fiber is removed during the processing of whole grains into refined flour. Certain fruits and vegetables, for example, cabbage, also contain poorly digested starches that reach the colon and result in the formation of gas. Most vegetables and fruits contain cellulose, another type of polysaccharide that is not digested as it passes through the small intestine. But unlike sugars and other starches, cellulose is used only very slowly by colonic bacteria. So the production of gas after eating fruits and vegetables usually is not great unless the fruits and vegetables also contain sugars or polysaccharides other than cellulose. Small amounts of air are continuously being swallowed and bacteria are constantly producing gas. Contractions of the intestinal muscles normally propel the gas through the intestines and cause the gas to be expelled. Flatulence prevents gas from accumulating in the intestines. But there are two other ways in which gas can escape the intestine. First, it can be absorbed across the lining of the intestine into the blood. The gas then travels in the blood and ultimately is excreted in the breath. Second, gas can be removed and used by certain types of bacteria within the intestine. Most of the gas formed by bacteria in the intestines is removed by other bacteria in the intestines.

TIA stands for \" .\" It refers to a moment in time when a portion of the brain is temporarily denied oxygen (ischemic), usually because of a blood clot in a tiny artery within the brain tissue itself. TIAs are sometimes called \"mini-strokes\" because they arrive with the same signs and symptoms as a full stroke, but those symptoms then disappear (transient). That\\'s not to say anyone exhibiting the should wait to see if those signs go away!

It\\'s not likely, but it\\'s possible. However, you cannot \"inherit TIAs\" because they\\'re not a disease. TIAs are a condition caused by something else (in this case, a blood clot).

It is applied topically to active canker sores for approximately 5-10 seconds. It seals individual lesions and resolves associated pain permanently. Research suggests that Debacterol may also speed healing of lesions. Rather than cauterization, benefits likely derive from its actions as a tissue denaturant. Debacterol is available to individuals by prescription for at-home use, or is offered as an in-office treatment by some medical and dental professionals. More information on can be found at Debacterol.com and EPIEN Medical. SILVER NITRATE Silver nitrate is a multi-purpose chemical cauterizing agent that can be used to seal acute canker sore lesions. It requires special storage due a highly reactive nature and is therefore for in-office use only. Silver nitrate should only be applied as an in-office treatment by medically trained individuals due to the risk of excessive tissue damage. It is not available by prescription. PAIN MANAGEMENT BENZOCAINE and MENTHOL Sometimes pain management for canker sores left to heal on their own is warranted. This is usually achieved with repeated application of compounds that contain nerve-numbing properties. Products containing Benzocaine (e.g., Orajel, Orabase, Kanka) or Menthol (e.g., Quantum Canker Cover) may help reduce pain with frequent application but do not speed healing. GELATIN Some medical products are designed to cover the lesion with Gelatin (e.g., Canker Melts) and may provide some pain relief through increasing the barrier to mechanical irritation and bacteria. These options do not speed healing and require frequent application. HOME REMEDIES There are many web entries describing home remedies for the pain associated with canker sores including salt-water rinses, tea bags, aloe gel, baking soda and even ice. PREVENTION Frequent or severe canker sore outbreaks should be evaluated by a doctor because they may indicate a more severe condition requiring specific medical management (e.g., Behcets Disease, PFAPA Syndrome). The efficacy of prevention techniques for uncomplicated canker sores is often debated, however these interventions may be helpful to some individuals: - Stress management - Avoid toothpaste with Sodium Lauryl Sulfate - Avoid highly acidic, rough or salty food - Decrease alcohol consumption - Decrease high carbohydrate foods. - Practice good moth hygiene - Address overt vitamin deficiencies (e.g., iron, B12, folate) ","votes":"188","membertype":"Contributor","helpful":"183","title":"What is the treatment for canker sores?","url":"http:\/\/answers.webmd.com\/answers\/1172711\/what-is-the-treatment-for-canker","membername":"JeffBecker","membervotes":"222"},{"descr":null,"questionId":"1178946","followers":null,"ans":"No one knows what causes canker sores, or why women are more likely to get them.

The doctor may treat the break without surgery by immobilizing the ankle if only one bone is broken, and if the bones are not out of place and the ankle is stable. Typically the doctor will do this by putting on a brace that works as a splint or by putting on a cast. If the ankle is unstable, the fracture will be treated surgically. Often, the ankle is made stable by using a metal plate and screws to hold the bones in place. Following the surgery, the ankle is protected with a splint until the swelling goes down and then with a cast. It usually takes at least six weeks for the bones to heal. Your doctor will probably ask you to keep weight off the ankle during that time so the bones can heal in the proper alignment. Ligaments and tendons can take longer to heal after a fracture is fully mended. It can take as long as two years to completely recover full painfree motion and strength after an ankle fracture, although most people are able to resume their normal daily routine within three to four months. After the doctor has determined it is safe for you to start moving your ankle, you may need physical therapy to provide gait training, balance, strengthening, and mobility exercises. The therapist will develop a home program that you can use to regain your previous normal function. It can take several months to return to a normal walking pattern without limping.

The pancreas has two main functions: secretion of insulin, which controls blood sugar levels, and secretion of digestive enzymes and hormones. Although not a perfect solution, these functions can be replaced through insulin injections and oral pancreatic enzymes with meals. Surgery to remove the pancreas completely is rarely done, so very few people have no pancreas at all. Much more common is having a pancreas that doesnt work properly. In people with type 1 diabetes, the pancreas stops making insulin but continues to make digestive enzymes. In cystic fibrosis and chronic pancreatitis, both insulin and enzyme production are often impaired. After surgery to remove part of the pancreas (such as for pancreatic cancer), in some cases the remaining pancreas cant make enough insulin, enzymes, or both. People with diabetes are at higher risk for heart attacks and strokes, and low pancreatic enzymes can lead to vitamin deficiencies. Artificial replacement doesnt work as well as a healthy pancreas, but it allows many people with pancreatic insufficiency to live full, active lives.

Maltreatment that takes place in the context of any romantic relationship is abuse as described by the above specific terms. It, therefore, affects men, women, or teen girls and boys, whether in a heterosexual or homosexual relationship. Intimate partner violence may consist of one or more forms, including emotional, psychological, physical, sexual, or economic abuse and is defined as one person in an intimate relationship using any means to control the other. Types of domestic abuse include physical, verbal (also called emotional, mental, or psychological abuse), sexual, economic\/financial, and spiritual abuse. Stalking and cyber-stalking are also forms of intimate partner abuse. Physical violence includes assault of any kind, ranging from pinching or pushing to choking, shooting, stabbing, and murder. Verbal, emotional, mental, or psychological abuse is described as using words to criticize, demean, or otherwise decrease the confidence of the victim. Sexual abuse refers to any behavior that uses sex to control or demean the victim, like intimidating the victim into engaging in unsafe sex or sexual practices in which he or she does not want to participate. Economic or financial abuse is described as limiting the victim\\'s financial freedom or security. Spiritual abusers either force the victim to participate in the batterer\\'s religious practices instead of their own or to raise mutual children in a religion that the victim is not in favor of. Stalking refers to repeatedly harassing and threatening behavior, including showing up at the victim\\'s home or workplace, placing harassing phone calls, voicemail, email or postal mail messages or objects, or vandalizing the victim\\'s property. It is usually committed by perpetrators of other forms of domestic violence. Domestic violence is a major public-health problem in that it affects millions of people and often results in physical and emotional injuries and even deaths. There tends to be a cycle of behavior, known as the cycle of violence, in abusive adult relationships. That cycle includes the tension-building, explosive, and tranquility\/honeymoon stages. The tension-building stage is described as the phase of the abusive relationship in which the abuser tends to engage in lower-level abuse, like pushing, insulting, and escalating demands for control. Simultaneously, the victim of abuse tends to try to appease the abuser in an effort to avoid worsening of the abuse. Acts of abuse escalate to a severe level during the explosive stage of intimate partner violence, manifesting as the most overt and serious acts of abuse and control, like slapping, punching, rape, or inhibiting the movements of the victim. The tranquility or honeymoon stage of the cycle of domestic violence tends to immediately follow the overt acts of aggression of the explosive stage and is usually characterized by the abuser seeming to be quite remorseful and apologetic for the abuse, making promises that it will never happen again and showering the victim with affection.

Duodenitis can only be diagnosed with a tissue biopsy, which is performed using endoscopy (esophagogastroduodenoscopy). The duodenum can become inflamed (irritated, swollen, and occupied by white blood cells) for various reasons. The most common is infection by H. pylori , a bacteria that lives in the stomach and\/or duodenum. About half of Americans over age 60 have been infected with H. pylori at some point in life. H. pylori stimulates increased acid production by the stomach and causes low-grade inflammation of the duodenum (duodenitis). Symptoms can include pain in the middle of the belly, or indigestion. In some cases, the inflammation of duodenitis worsens to create a small sore (ulcer) in the duodenums wall. Less commonly, inflammatory conditions can cause duodenitis: Crohn\\'s disease Ulcerative colitis Whipples disease Severe stress caused by surgery or a serious infection (sepsis) Cases of duodenitis or duodenal ulcer caused by H. pylori can usually be cured with antibiotics and stomach acid-suppressing drugs.

Dental implants can give you back your smile and help you feel better about yourself. Improved oral health. Dental implants don\\'t require reducing other teeth, as a tooth-supported bridge does. Because nearby teeth are not altered to support the implant, more of your own teeth are left intact, improving your long-term oral health. Individual implants also allow easier access between teeth, improving oral hygiene. Durability. Implants are very durable and will last many years. With good care, many implants last a lifetime.

The plan addresses your specific needs and is prepared by a team of professionals who are specially trained and experienced in oral surgery and restorative dentistry. This team approach provides coordinated care based on the implant option that is best for you. Next, the tooth root implant, which is a small post made of titanium, is placed into the bone socket of the missing tooth. As the jawbone heals, it grows around the implanted metal post, anchoring it securely in the jaw. The healing process can take from 6 to 12 weeks. Once the implant has bonded to the jawbone, a small connector post - called an abutment - is attached to the post to securely hold the new tooth. To make your new tooth or teeth, your dentist makes impressions of your teeth, and creates a model of your bite (which captures all of your teeth, their type, and arrangement). Your new tooth or teeth are based on this model. A replacement tooth, called a crown, is then attached to the abutment. Instead of one or more individual crowns, some patients may have attachments placed on the implant that retain and support a removable denture. Your dentist also will match the color of your new teeth to your natural teeth. Because the implant is secured within the jawbone, the replacement teeth look, feel, and function just like your own natural teeth.

A few people experience chronic urticaria: hives that occur on most days of the week for at least six weeks. Infections by viruses, bacteria, or parasites can occasionally cause hives.

The most commonly used oral treatments are antihistamines, which help oppose the effects of the histamine leaked by mast cells. The main side effect of antihistamines is drowsiness. Many antihistamines are available without prescription, such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl), taken in doses of 25 milligrams and chlorpheniramine (Chlor-Trimeton), taken in a dose of 4 milligrams. These can be taken up to three times a day, but because these medications can cause drowsiness, they are often taken at bedtime. Those who take them should be especially careful and be sure they are fully alert before driving or participating in other activities requiring mental concentration. Loratadine (Claritin, 10 milligrams) is an antihistamine available over the counter that is less likely to cause drowsiness. Also approved for over-the-counter use is hydroxyzine (Atarax, Vistaril), which causes drowsiness, and its breakdown product, cetirizine (Zyrtec, 10 milligrams), which is mildly sedating. Antihistamines that require a prescription include cyproheptadine (Periactin), which tends to cause drowsiness. Prescription antihistamines that cause little sedation are fexofenadine (Allegra) and levocetirizine (Xyzal). Sometimes physicians combine these with other types of antihistamines called H2 blockers, such as ranitidine (Zantac) and cimetidine (Tagamet). This antihistamine list is not exhaustive. Physicians individualize treatment plans to suit specific patients and modify them depending on the clinical response. Oral steroids (prednisone, [Medrol]) can help severe cases of hives in the short term, but their usefulness is limited by the fact that many cases of hives last too long for steroid use to be continued safely. Other treatments have been used for urticaria as well, including montelukast (Singulair), ultraviolet radiation, antifungal antibiotics, agents that suppress the immune system, and tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline [Elavil, Endep], nortriptyline [Pamelor, Aventyl], doxepin [Sinequan, Adapin]). Evidence to support the benefit of such treatments is sparse. In ordinary cases, they are rarely needed. Topical therapies for hives are available but are generally ineffective. They include creams and lotions which help numb nerve endings and reduce itching. Some ingredients which can accomplish this are camphor, menthol, diphenhydramine, and pramoxine. Many of these topical preparations require no prescription. Cortisone-containing creams (steroids), even strong ones requiring a prescription, are not very helpful in controlling the itch of hives.

Make sure that you are not using products that are over-drying your skin because that will lead to increased oil gland production. You should exclude any underlying skin conditions such as eczema, psoriasis, or seborrhea that may alter your skins oil production. You may also have combination skin (elements of dry and oily skin). Because the nose, chin, center of the forehead, and the cheeks all have more oil glands than any other part of the face, it is not surprising that those areas tend to be oilier and may break out more frequently than other areas. At the same time, the areas that lack oil glands can become dry and flaky. Problems occur when you attempt to treat combination skin as one specific skin type. Many ingredients that are appropriate for the T-zone (the area along the center of the forehead and down the nose where most of the active oil glands on the face are located) won\\'t help the drier parts of cheeks, eyes, or jaws -- and vice versa. More often than not, separate products are required to deal with the different skin types on your face because different skin types, even on the same face, must be treated differently to truly feel and look better. Once you accept this fact and adjust your routine, combination skin can be brought into balance, at least to the extent that using the right products allows. If anything, using overly abrasive or irritating skin-care products on oilier areas will only worsen combination skin\\'s dual nature by making dry areas drier and creating a rough, reddened appearance over oily areas. Plus, treating skin harshly does not correct or improve oiliness in any way because combination skin should be viewed and treated as separate skin types.

Medical History Your doctor will ask questions to find out whether there is a medical cause for your insomnia. These include questions about whether you: Have any new or ongoing health problems Have painful injuries or health conditions (such as arthritis) Take any medicines (over-the-counter or prescription) Other questions are aimed at finding work or leisure habits that might be causing your insomnia. Your doctor may ask about your work and exercise routines; your use of caffeine, tobacco, or alcohol; and your long-distance travel history. Your doctor also may ask whether you have any new or ongoing work, personal problems, or other stresses in your life. In addition, you may be asked whether you have other family members with sleep problems. Sleep History To get a better sense of your sleep problem, your doctor will ask you details about your sleep habits, including: How often you have trouble sleeping and how long the problem has persisted When you go to bed and get up on workdays and days off How long it takes you to fall asleep, how often you wake up at night, and how long it takes to fall back asleep If you snore loudly and frequently, or wake up gasping or feeling out of breath How refreshed you feel when you wake up, and how tired you feel during the day How often you doze off or have trouble staying awake during routine tasks, especially driving You may be asked to keep a sleep diary for 1 to 2 weeks so you can answer these questions easily. Your bed partner may help you keep the sleep diary. To see what might be causing or worsening your insomnia, your doctor will also ask you: Whether you worry about falling asleep, staying asleep, or getting enough sleep What you eat or drink, and whether you take medicines before going to bed What routine you follow before going to bed What the noise level, lighting, and temperature are like where you sleep What distractions, such as a TV or computer, might be in your bedroom Physical Exam Your doctor will do a physical exam to rule out other medical problems that might cause insomnia. You may also need blood tests to check for thyroid problems or other conditions that can cause sleep problems. Sleep Study (Polysomnogram) A polysomnogram is a recording of your breathing, movements, heart function, and brain activity during sleep.

We have a lot of poison ivy both here in Michigan, and at my brother\\'s house in Ohio, and the leaves are very much green except in the fall and winter, or if the summer weather is especially hot and dry, such as we had a few weeks ago. As soon as it cooled down a little and we got some rain, the leaves turned back to bright green again. I used to do tree work for a living, and I have seen individual vines as big as my arm. On one occasion, I had the unpleasant task of cutting down a poison ivy \"plant\" with over 40 large vines stemming from a trunk nearly six inches in diameter! Some of the leaves were almost as big as my hand! Despite all my precautions, I still ended up with a rash on most of both arms and on my face, and lost three days of work as a result. One of our other workers foolishly climbed a tree that had several vines on it, and he wound up in the emergency room the next day with a rash covering over 50% of his body. It is also important to bear in mind that the oil from the plants can remain active for up to two years on other surfaces that it does not bond with (such as shoes, gloves, and tools), and the oil on the plants themselves remains active for the same period even if the plants have been killed. So even after using an herbicide to kill them, you must take just as much care to avoid contact with the plants.

This is comparable to the diaphragm\\'s effectiveness with normal use (e.g. occasional errors). I have personally not used the VCF, but I have heard that it does not drip like other spermicides. I have used both the diaphragm and the Today sponge (90% effective according to its manufacturer). Like other non-hormonal methods they rely on spermicide for effectiveness. The sponge has 1 gram of nonoxyol 9 (much more than the amount used in a diaphragm jelly spermicide). Consequently, the Sponge can be used for more than one ejaculation (unlike a diaphragm where one is supposed to add more spermicide using a plunger like those designed for vaginal yeast cream). Personal OPINION? The Sponge was easier than the diaphragm for camping, and it absorbed all the ejaculate so no mess. Sponge was more expensive. Diaphragm required planning and even I occasionally did not follow instructions (e.g. did not use more spermicide). Diaphragm can be drippy after removal. Bottom line, consider trying both the VCF and the Sponge. See how they work for you. If you are accustomed to the effectiveness rate of hormonal forms of birth control you could consider using condoms as an additional protection.

No. 1: Control Your Weight If you are at a healthy weight, maintaining that weight may be the most important thing you can do to prevent osteoarthritis. If you are overweight, losing weight may be your best hedge against the disease. Obesity is clearly a risk factor for developing osteoarthritis. Data from the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a program of studies designed to assess the health and nutrition of Americans, showed that obese women were nearly four times as likely as non-obese women to have osteoarthritis. The risk for obese men was nearly five times greater than for non-obese men. Being overweight strains the joints, particularly those that bear the body\\'s weight such as the knees, hips, and joints of the feet, causing the cartilage to wear away. If you already have osteoarthritis, losing weight may help improve symptoms. No. 2: Exercise If the muscles that run along the front of the thigh are weak, research shows you have an increased risk of painful knee osteoarthritis. Fortunately, even relatively minor increases in the strength of these muscles, the quadriceps, can reduce the risk. If fear of joint pain after exercise keeps you from exercising, try using heat and cold on painful joints or take pain relievers, which may make it easier for you to exercise and stay active. The safest exercises are those that place the least body weight on the joints, such as bicycling, swimming, and water exercise. Light weight lifting exercises are another option, but if you already have osteoarthritis, first speak with your doctor. No. 3: Avoid Injuries or Get Them Treated Suffering a joint injury when you are young predisposes you to osteoarthritis in the same joint when you are older. Injuring a joint as an adult may put the joint at even greater risk. People who injured their knee as an adult had a five times greater risk of osteoarthritis in the joint. To avoid joint injuries when exercising or playing sports, the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases recommends the following: Avoid bending knees past 90 degrees when doing half knee bends. Keep feet as flat as possible during stretches to avoid twisting knees. When jumping, land with your knees bent. Do warm-up exercises before sports, even less vigorous ones such as golf. Cool down after vigorous sports. Wear properly fitting shoes that provide shock absorption and stability. Exercise on the softest surface available; avoid running on asphalt and concrete. If you have a joint injury, it\\'s important to get prompt medical treatment and take steps to avoid further damage, such as modifying high-impact movements or using a brace to stabilize the joint. No. 4: Eat Right Although no specific diet has been shown to prevent osteoarthritis, certain nutrients have been associated with a reduced risk of the disease or its severity. They include: Omega-3 fatty acids. These healthy fats reduce joint inflammation, while unhealthy fats can increase it. Good sources of omega-3 fatty acids include fish oil and certain plant\/nut oils, including walnut, canola, soybean, flaxseed\/linseed, and olive. Vitamin C. One study of participants in the Framingham Study found that moderate intake of vitamin C (120-200 milligrams per day) reduced the risk of osteoarthritis progression threefold. You can get more vitamin C in your diet by eating green peppers, citrus fruits and juices, strawberries, tomatoes, broccoli, turnip greens and other leafy greens, sweet and white potatoes, and cantaloupe. Vitamin D. Another study of Framingham Study participants showed that people who have knee osteoarthritis and low blood levels of vitamin D are three times more likely to experience disease progression, compared to people with high levels of the vitamin. Your body makes most of the vitamin D it needs in response to sunlight. You can get more vitamin D in your diet by eating fatty fish such as salmon, mackerel, tuna, sardines, and herring; vitamin D-fortified milk and cereal; and eggs.

But the accuracy depends on many things. These include: How you use them -- Be sure to follow the directions and check the expiration date. When you use them -- The amount of hCG or pregnancy hormone in your urine increases with time. So, the earlier after a missed period you take the test the harder it is to spot the hCG. If you wait one week after a missed period to test, you are more apt to have an accurate result. Also, testing your urine first thing in the morning may boost the accuracy. Who uses them -- The amount of hCG in the urine is different for every pregnant woman. So, some women will have accurate results on the day of the missed period while others will need to wait longer. The brand of test -- Some home pregnancy tests are more sensitive than others. So, some tests are better than others at spotting hCG early on. Many HPTs claim to be 99% accurate on the day you miss your period. But research suggests that most HPTs do not consistently spot pregnancy that early.

Begin brushing your child\\'s teeth, without toothpaste, when his or her first tooth comes in. Clean and massage gums in areas without teeth. Floss once all the baby teeth have come in. Make sure your child is getting enough fluoride, which helps reduce cavities. If your local water supply does not contain fluoride, ask your dentist or doctor how your child should get it. Schedule regular dental visits by your child\\'s first birthday. Dentists also offer special sealant coatings, which can help prevent tooth decay in children. These are expensive, however. Other techniques to help prevent baby bottle tooth decay include: Not filling bottles with sugar water and soft drinks. Bottles are for milk, water, formula, and special electrolyte-containing solutions when the child has diarrhea. Juices, mixed half and half with water to avoid empty calories, are a way to interest your child in a \"sippy cup.\" Soft drinks are not recommended for children as they have no nutritional value. Never allowing your child to fall asleep with a bottle containing anything but water. Never giving your child a pacifier dipped in anything sweet. Decreasing your child\\'s sugar intake, especially between meals. It\\'s never too late to break bad habits. If your child drinks sweetened liquids from the bottle and\/or sleeps with a bottle, break the habit now and reduce the risk of baby bottle tooth decay by: Gradually diluting the bottle contents with water over two to three weeks.

The domino effect goes something like this: * A child has trouble breathing at night, which explains the snoring and sparks a bad nights sleep. * The labored breathing ultimately leads to a lack of oxygen. * A bad nights sleep translates to being constantly tired and unable to concentrate or learn new things easily. * This, in turn, exacerbates developmental delays, poor memory and behavioral problems in terms of attention, low frustration tolerance and poor impulse control. * Over time, prolonged poor sleep can affect a childs IQ and education. I get asked about snoring children on a regular basis. Is it normal? Is it considered the same as an adult who snores? Between 10 and 20 percent of normal children snore on a regular or intermittent basis, making the line between normal snoring and abnormal snoring seem a bit fuzzy. Its when snoring hampers restful sleep that it should be addressed, as in adults. But there are a few things unique to snoring children. In 2002, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that all children be screened for snoring and that a diagnosis be conducted to determine if a child is experiencing normal (primary) snoring or obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome. About one to three percent of children not only snore, but also suffer from breathing problems during their sleep. First, speak with your pediatrician to get an accurate diagnosis. Though obstructive sleep apnea among adults is commonly discussed, its true that children can suffer from the same condition. And they wont necessarily grow out of it. Although most younger children with OSA are not overweight, which is typically associated with OSA, its key to determine if weight is a contributing factor. Now that childhood obesity is growing at an alarming rate  with 1 out of 3 kids today considered overweight or obese  its no surprise to me that more kids are getting diagnosed with OSA. Other underlying medical conditions, especially allergies or asthma, could also be to blame, in which case a nasal steroid spray could help improve nasal obstruction and OSA symptoms in children that also have allergies. If GERD (gastroenterological reflux disorder) is a factor, this condition could also be treated. There could be other reasons, though, that are unique to children. A child could have been born with a small jaw or a small airway that makes it hard to breathe fully. Theres also the possibility that the muscles, and the nerves controlling those muscles, are not well integrated during sleep and therefore do not open the airway enough. And then theres the chance that a child has enlarged tonsils and adenoids that prevent normal breathing. This last possibility, in fact, is very common among youngsters. When the problems are significant enough, parents can choose to have their childs tonsils and adenoids removed. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, more than 263,000 children in the U.S. have tonsillectomies each year and sleep apnea is a major reason. Getting to the bottom of a childs constant snoring that affects his or her quality of life is critical during those early developmental years. But aside from addressing any medical conditions triggering the problem, its also important to instill good sleep habits  or hygiene  in your children from as early an age as possible. If you teach your children how to prepare for sleep and to embrace it as an healthy component to life (and that they need their sleep to enjoy their days maximally), then they will naturally lower their risk for sleep disorders and grow into adults who experience restful, rejuvenating nights on a routine basis-- maybe more so than their own parents! No one likes a cranky, overtired child. Or an adult in that same state for that matter! Heres another way to look at it: If your kids can increase their mood and happiness, and possibly even their IQ, through more restful sleep, wouldnt you want to encourage that?

Breus","membervotes":"0"},{"descr":" MS","questionId":"1177299","followers":"0","ans":"People who sleep (or lie awake not sleeping) near a snorer often report signs that may indicate a more serious problem. Witnessed apnea (stopping breathing) or gasping can suggest a breathing problem such as sleep apnea or heart problems. Leg kicking or other jerking movements can indicate a problem such as periodic limb movement disorder or restless leg syndrome. Referral to a sleep specialist may be recommended if obstructive sleep apnea, restless leg syndrome, or periodic limb movement disorder are suspected. If someone\\'s sleep is disrupted because of snoring, the person may also notice other symptoms. Frequently, people complain of difficulty waking up in the morning or a feeling of insufficient sleep. They may take daytime naps or fall asleep during meetings. If sleep disruption is severe, people have fallen asleep while driving or performing their daily work. Daytime sleepiness can be estimated with a sleepiness inventory, and a sleep study can be performed if a sleeping problem is suspected. There are two general types of sleep studies: Home sleep study A home (unattended) sleep study can measure some basic parameters of sleep and breathing. Often, it will include pulse oximetry (a measurement of the level of oxygen in the blood), a record of movement, snoring, and apneic (stop in breathing) events. A home study can prove that there are no sleeping problems or suggest that there may be a problem. If a home sleep study suggests a problem, a full sleep study (polysomnography) often is performed in a clinic. If the sleepiness inventory and sleep study suggest there are no sleeping or breathing disorders, a person is diagnosed with primary snoring. Treatment options then can be discussed. Epworth Sleepiness Scale The Epworth Sleepiness Scale is a test based on a patient\\'s own report that establishes the severity of sleepiness. A person rates the likelihood of falling asleep during specific activities. Using the scale from 0 to 3 below, patients rank their risk of dozing in the chart below. (This chart can be printed out and taken to the doctor.) After ranking each category, the total score is calculated. The range is 0 to24, with the higher the score the more sleepiness. Scoring: 0 to 9 = Average daytime sleepiness. 10 to 15 = Excessive daytime sleepiness. 16 to 24 = Moderate to severe daytime sleepiness. Breaking it down further, excessive daytime sleepiness is greater than 10. Primary snorers usually have a score less than 10, and individuals with moderate to severe sleep apnea usually have a score greater than 16.

Loud snoring occurs in almost 25% of the population. By itself, snoring is not considered dangerous to health. However, in about 5-7% of all men (and 2-4% of women), the snoring is associated with episodes of stopping breathing observed by a bed partner. Additionally, daytime fatigue and sleepiness may be present. When these symptoms are present with snoring, sleep apnea is a possible diagnosis. Other features of sleep apnea include headaches, high blood pressure, and repeated awakenings at night. Sleep apnea is a serious medical condition and should be treated. One of the biggest risk factors for sleep apnea is being overweight. However, having a small chin, small mouth or other variations in the face bones can also increase the risk of sleep apnea. Treatment of sleep apnea is most often with a CPAP machine. Oral appliances and surgery are alternatives, but are not as effective as CPAP. If you suspect that your boyfriend has sleep apnea, observe him while he sleeps and try to determine if he stops breathing. You should go with him to his doctor and discuss his snoring and describe what you see when his is sleeping. Mention his other symptoms, as well... If his doctor thinks he has sleep apnea, tests will likely need to be done. Your doctor will need to order CPAP or other treatments.

The interval of maximal fertility begins five (Wilcox, 1995) to six days (Bigelow, 2004) before ovulation and declines after ovulation occurs. Lets look at some popular do-it-yourself methods of determining ovulation: calendar, basal body temperature charting, over-the-counter ovulation predictor kits. Calendar Charting ones cycles on a calendar, or using a string of colored beads (cycle beads), are low-tech methods of attempting to predict ones fertile time. These methods of ovulation prediction tend to work best in women with very regular cycles between 26-32 days in length. These methods are less exact at identifying the exact occurrence of an ovulation. An improvement in accuracy can be accomplished if the woman is taught to identify changes in cervical secretions (Bigelow, 2004). The LH surge and spike in estrogen levels, precede ovulation by about 16-24 hours. These hormonal peaks create the typical appearance of fertile mucus such as clear egg white consistency. However, recent intercourse or other sources of increased estrogen [e.g., polycystic ovarian syndrome] can mimic fertile mucus. Basal Body Temperature Charts Just prior to ovulation, there is a modest drop in baseline body temperature. At ovulation and after, the temperature rises about a half-degree Fahrenheit. That ovulation has occurred is identified after the fact. This is not as helpful for trying to conceive (or prevent conception). It does provide information about when the woman might ovulate in the following months, however. Ovulation Predictor Kits Perhaps the most reliable method to predict ovulation is to use an over-the-counter ovulation prediction kit (OPK). These kits measure the amount of LH in a womans urine. When that level peaks, one assumes that ovulation will follow within the next 24-36 hours. There have been numerous research studies suggesting that the over the counter OPKs are very reliable when used according to package directions (Eichner, 2004). One earlier study of five different OPKs (Ghazeeri, 2000) was able to identify an almost two-fold difference in sensitivity between the most, and least, sensitive kits. This suggests that OPK manufacturers should indicate the sensitivity of their product, as many home pregnancy tests do. One of the major difficulties with ovulation prediction\/documentation is normal cycle variations. We suggest to women that it takes about 14 days after ovulation for the menstrual period to appear. This interval is called the luteal phase. Yet a variety of studies have demonstrated the length of a luteal phase can range from 10-16 days. Even more varied is the interval from the first day of flow to day of ovulation (follicular phase). The mean length of the follicular phase can range from 15-16.5 days plus\/minus 2.6 to 3.5 days (Fehring, 2006). Therefore the variability between your cycle and that of your best girlfriends is likely to be in the weeks that precede ovulation (follicular phase).

People normally drink varying amounts of liquid depending on their activity level and the temperature indoors and out. There are two main medical conditions that should be considered if you feel constantly thirsty: Diabetes mellitus: The common form of diabetes, in which high blood sugar levels spill into the urine, increasing urine flow. The excessive urination leads to dehydration, causing the person to become thirsty and drink more fluid. Diabetes insipidus: An uncommon problem in which a hormone called anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) is either low, absent, or not functioning properly.

If the urethra is injured, a person may develop urethra obstructions or strictures. Urethral strictures occur when the urethra is injured or scarred by an infection and then narrows. As a result, problems with the normal passage of urine and semen can develop. Urethral injuries can have devastating long-term consequences, such as potential complications of impotence, stricture and incontinence. Injuries may affect either the anterior or posterior part of the urethra. In most cases, anterior urethral trauma is characterized as a blunt injury to the perineum  the area between the genitals and anus  since the urethra is located near the skin in this area. This type of trauma is often the result of straddle-like injuries, such as when a child forcefully straddles a bicycle or fence. Penetrating injuries to the anterior urethra, such as those from a gunshot wound, also may cause strictures or obstructions. Posterior urethral trauma affects the part of the urethra that travels inside the body. This type of trauma almost always occurs as a result of pelvic fractures following automobile accidents, serious falls or industrial crash injuries. Do hope this helps you.

Serious cardiovascular events included things like a heart attack, unstable angina (chest pain caused by lack of oxygen to the heart), and arrythmias). The study used a strong overall methodology by comparing the rates of these events in people given the real drug (varenicline) versus those given an identical pill with no real drug in it (placebo). The main overall, finding was that 1.06% of smokers given varenicline reported a serious cardiac event compared with 0.82% of those given placebo pills. Although these percentages are small, because the analyses included 8216 participants the difference is considered statistically significant. Another outcome in the study was \"all cause mortality\" (death). It was reported that 7\/4908 patients given varenicline died (1.4 per thousand) versus 7\/3308 of participants given placebo (2.1 per thousand). These numbers were described as too small for proper statistical analysis, but it looks like those tobacco users given placebo were 1.5 times (or 50%) more likely to die in the studies. The part of the paper I found most persuasive was where the authors pointed out that despite varenicline more than doubling the rate of smoking cessation (which should reduce cardiovascular risks), the varenicline participants still appeared to have a slightly higher rate of cardiovascular events. However, there are two pieces of information I would like to have clarified before coming to a conclusion based on this study. The first is clarification that the analyses were based on the number of patients with cardiovascular events, and not the number of events per se (i.e. to ensure that the same patient was not double counted for different events). The second is clarification on what the event rates were when corrected for time on drug. In most of these studies participants used the drug for 12 weeks or less, but were followed up for 24-52 weeks. If the excess events on varenicline were primarily occurring during the time on drug, that would give me more confidence that this may be a causal effect. If the events were occurring primarily off drug this may make me concerned that the differences might be caused by differential drop-out (the tendency for people receiving placebo, who are less likely to quit smoking, to therefore also be more likely to drop out of the study follow-up and so their cardiovascular events be less likely to be reported).

The simple answer is that we don\\'t know. Formal studies to evaluate this question have failed to show that either going cold turkey or tapering off is better. So the choice is really yours. The important thing is to know that women in general have about a 50\/50 chance of experiencing hot flashes again (although maybe not as severe as initially) after stopping. Some studies suggest that symptoms peak within 3 months after stopping hormones. After you stop, take some time to evaluate how you feel before beginning any new medication so you don\\'t get the two effects confused. There are a couple of other things to keep an eye on once you\\'ve stopped HT. If you develop vaginal dryness or recurrent urinary tract infections, ask your clinician about vaginal estrogens. Nonhormonal lubricants and moisturizers can also help with dryness. And, you might want to ask about a bone density test. We know that women who stop HT often lose bone. Depending on your bone density score and risk profile, you might be a candidate for an osteoporosis drug (bone-sparing). At any rate, discuss calcium and vitamin D supplements, weight-bearing exercise, and fall prevention with your clinician. Another good idea is to have your cholesterol rechecked in about 3 months after stopping HT because hormones can affect \"lipid levels\" (both good and bad). And if you\\'re taking a thyroid medication for an underactive thyroid, your dose might need to be adjusted. Thanks for your Reply!

The risk seems to be greater in women taking combined therapy (estrogen plus a progestogen) than in women taking estrogen alone. And, it may be that starting HT right away after menopause is also associated with greater risk. The good news is that the risk returns to baseline within several years after stopping HT. You should also be aware that combined HT can make it more difficult to read your mammogram (both while you\\'re taking hormones and in the first years after stopping). As a result, you might be called back for additional views or biopsy of suspicious areas. Right now most experts recommend limiting HT to several years. The NAMS 2010 HT position statement ( www.menopause.org\/PSht10.pdf ) suggests that longer use is acceptable for a woman if she believes that the benefits outweigh the risks (especially if she\\'s had trouble stopping therapy). The other condition includes women with low bone mass or osteoporosis who cannot tolerate osteoporosis drugs. The one exception to limiting HT to a few years is the woman who has had premature menopause, either because of natural failure of her ovaries or surgical removal. In that case, most experts are comfortable advising you to continue HT at least until the age of natural menopause, about age 50, at which time you can reassess. If you\\'ve been taking hormones for a very long time, you might want to start by discussing a lower dose. Many clinicians now prescribe half the dose we used to use.

Medical providers who feel they can just look in the throat and accurately diagnose strep, tend to be wrong half of the time; not much better than a coin toss. There are some suspicious signs of strep that one can notice by simply looking at the throat. Many people get all excited when they see white stuff on the tonsils. This is not a definite sign of strep, and can even be food particles. Strep tends to cause petechiae  tiny, irregularly-shaped red dots appearing on the back of the palate, and on or near the uvula. The back of the throat and palate area is usually an angry-looking, fire-engine red. The kids look and act sick. Their breath smells like they have never used a toothbrush in their life. For those clinicians who have spent their careers insulted by this strep smell, we usually have a pretty good idea that this child probably has strep. I still test them. If the rapid strep test is surprisingly negative (it is not 100%), I tend to get a throat culture. A culture takes two days, but the accuracy approaches 100 percent. Streptococcal infections have a bad, historical reputation, since it has the potential to cause heart-damaging rheumatic fever, kidney disease, life-threatening pneumonia, and other serious complications. The reason why we treat strep when we diagnosis is to prevent these complications that are relatively rare now. If you have a good immune system, our bodies can easily overcome an occasional attack of strep. Kids who are excluded from school with strep should have at least 24 hours of treatment, and show improvement before returning to school. Treatment with antibiotics, usually a penicillin-based one if you are not allergic to them, will last about 10 days. There is really no need to keep children home that long. I always recommend that they change their toothbrush after a day of treatment, since strep can colonize on wet toothbrushes. If you have several kids who keep their toothbrushes in the same drawer, touching, it is the same as sharing toothbrushes. For the teenagers, I warn them about taking a clandestine swig out of the milk or orange juice container in the refrigerator when no one is watching. If a sore throat persists more than a week or so, accompanied by fatigue, a mono test should be considered.

My normal yearly physical exams include blood work and my liver numbers were always in the normal range. In the summer of 2012, my insurance decided to change my Singulair prescription to Montelukast because it\\'s cheaper (how nice of them!). Everyone said it\\'s the same exact thing as Singulair, but for some reason I was apprehensive and just didn\\'t trust this new medicine. In February 2013, I had my yearly physical and my liver numbers had sky rocketed way beyond the normal ranges (they look at 2 numbers, AST and ALT). Even though I\\'m not a heavy drinker, the doctor had me stop all alcohol for 6 weeks and then I was retested. The results were exactly the same as before so alcohol wasn\\'t the culprit. The doctor wanted to send me to the hospital for additional tests, including to check for hepatitis, to see why I was exhibiting liver damage. I asked if I could try fasting from Montelukast for 6 weeks first before undergoing a bunch of other tests and the doctor agreed because he said I wasn\\'t in danger. However, he didn\\'t think Montelukast was the cause. I had a feeling it was Montelukast because nothing else had changed in the last few years other than that. After 6 weeks of not taking Montelukast, I was retested and my liver numbers dropped by HALF!

For patients with symptoms, the most common symptoms are intermittent claudication and rest pain. Intermittent claudication: Intermittent claudication refers to pain or cramping in the arms or legs that occurs with exercise and subsides with rest. The severity and location of the pain of intermittent claudication vary depending upon the location and extent of blockage of the involved artery. The most common location of intermittent claudication is the calf muscle. The pain in the calf muscle occurs only during exercise such as walking, and the pain steadily increases with continued walking until the patient has to stop due to intolerable pain. Then the pain quickly subsides during rest. Intermittent claudication can affect one or both legs. Rest pain: Rest pain occurs when the artery occlusion is so critical that there is not enough blood and oxygen supply to the lower extremities even at rest. The pain typically affects the feet, is usually severe, and occurs at night when the patient assumes a supine position (lying down, face up). Other symptoms and signs of peripheral artery disease include: Numbness of the extremities. Weakness and atrophy (diminished size and strength) of the calf muscle. A feeling of coldness in the legs or feet. Changes in color of the feet; feet turn pale when they are elevated, and turn dusky red in dependent position. Hair loss over the dorsum of the feet and thickening of the toenails. Painful ulcers and\/or gangrene in tissue where there is critical ischemia (lack of blood and oxygen), typically in the toes.

Patients with severe sepsis or septic shock have a mortality (death) rate of about 40%-60%. Newborns and pediatric patients with sepsis have about a 9%-36% mortality rate. Investigators have developed a scoring system, called the MEDS score, based on the patient\\'s symptoms to estimate prognosis. There are a large number of complications that may occur with sepsis. The complications are related to the type of initial infection (for example, in lung infection with sepsis, a potential complication could be a need for respiratory support) and the severity of sepsis (for example, septic shock related to a limb infection that could require limb amputation). Consequently, each patient is likely to have the potential for complications related to the source of sepsis; in general, the complications are due to organ dysfunction, damage, or loss.

That\\'s because all men have a prostate. Take a look at this overview of prostate problems to assess your risk for trouble with your prostate. Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) . BPH, also known as an enlarged prostate, is growth of the prostate gland to an unhealthy size. A man\\'s chances of having BPH go up with age: age 31-40: one in 12 age 51-60: about one in two over age 80: more than eight in 10. However, only about one out of every two men ever has BPH symptoms that need treatment. BPH does not lead to prostate cancer, although both are common in older men. Prostate Cancer . Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men (besides skin cancer). About one man in six will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in his lifetime. Let\\'s keep these numbers in perspective, though. Because prostate cancer is usually slow growing, only about one in 35 men will die of prostate cancer. Like BPH, the risk for prostate cancer increases with age. About two out of every three men with prostate cancer are over 65. No one knows exactly what causes prostate cancer, but risk factors associated with it include: Family history. Having a father or brother with prostate cancer more than doubles your risk. Race. African-American men are more likely to get prostate cancer than Caucasians, and the cancer is usually more advanced when discovered. African-American men and men with a family history of prostate cancer usually begin prostate cancer screening at an earlier age than Caucasian men who do not have prostate cancer in their family history.

No herbal supplements have been proven to prevent prostate cancer. Studies of selenium, a mineral that has shown some promise, are underway.

One is the actual size. As the gland gets bigger its harder to push the urine through. The other cause for symptoms for men with signs of prostate enlargement isnt really the size of the gland, but the fact that the gland and surrounding tissues are involved with smooth muscle. Its part of the normal architecture, that those muscles squeeze down. So as they squeeze the urethra they block the flow as well, and thats another whole category of medications called alpha blockers that relax those muscles. The advantage to the alpha blockers is that they work very quickly, men have remarkable improvement in their urinating symptoms almost within days, and often avoid the need for any surgical intervention. The problem with the alpha blockers is they might not last as long, so maybe after a year or two or three, the symptoms might start to come back. Thats where the 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors come into play, the Avodart and the Proscar, and that they actually shrink the gland. And sometimes the combination of the two is what has the most success for some men. SL: What are the side effects? The Avodart and the Proscar have a very low incidence of side effects that are sexual. The main ones are sometimes an increase in sex drive, sometimes a decrease in sexual ability, and for many men a decrease in volume of ejaculate, because youre shrinking the glandular structure. For the alpha blockers, their main side effect is that they relax the smooth muscle, so depending on whether youre using a new one or an old one, some men can have problems with blood pressure, and also retrograde ejaculation where because the bladder neck is relaxed, when the man ejaculates the semen goes backwards into the bladder. SL: That doesnt sound very good. Its, retrograde ejaculation is generally its painless. Men, though, become very obsessed with how things should be and when theres changes such as reduced volume they become upset with that and want to restore it.

In a review of many studies Cox (2004), found the ability to identify abnormal cells from conventional Pap smears was 71% compared to 81% for LBP. In addition to changes in the way that cells can be collected, the prepared slides can have supplementary interpretations. Automated, computerized readings of the slides (e.g., AutoPAP or PAP Net) can be done before, or after, the human cytologist examines the slide. Paradoxically, increasing PAP smear sampling among low risk women actual increases your chance of getting a false positive one day.

The less pressure there is on the walls of your blood vessels, the less likely they are to burst. The more common ischemic strokes are caused by blood clots -- the same villains responsible for heart attacks. To decrease the risks, you need to keep your arteries clear of plaque -- the gunk that builds up in them and leads to clotting. Ways to do this include: exercising for at least half an hour on most days of the week eating right -- preferably a diet low in saturated fat (such as that in red meat) and high in fruits and vegetables losing weight (if you\\'re overweight) not smoking -- smokers are twice as likely to have a stroke. Certain heart conditions -- such as atrial fibrillation, which causes the heart to pump less efficiently than it should -- can also cause clots that lead to strokes. High blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol raise your risk too. If you have any of these conditions, you\\'ll need to keep them under control with lifestyle changes or medication. Low-dose aspirin can reduce stroke risk, although it may not help younger men already at low risk for stroke. Talk to your doctor before starting aspirin therapy. Some risk factors for stroke -- such as increasing age and family history -- can\\'t be controlled. Even so, making changes to your way of life can still have a big positive effect.

In other words, warfarin makes it difficult for your blood to clot. This is why people who take warfarin are routinely warned to be careful shaving or performing other activities in which they may cut themselves. Even a small wound can bleed a lot when a person is on warfarin. Warfarin is normally prescribed to people who have experienced excessive clotting (like a deep vein thrombosis or ) or who have certain heart conditions that may increase the chance of a clot occurring (such as \\'). However, warfarin also may be prescribed on a short- or long-term basis for a host of other medical issues, such as reducing the risk of a DVT after joint replacement surgery. A person who abruptly stops taking warfarin is at a higher risk for because the blood regains its ability to clot. Stroke in the brain can be caused when a clot blocks an artery carrying vital oxygen to brain tissues. If the brain tissue is deprived of oxygen in this way, the tissue will die.

While a decrease in desire can be caused by many things, including a negative relationship with a partner, or other life stresses, physical causes are often traced to a decrease in the hormones estrogen and testosterone that occur during menopause.

Cholesterol may build-up in the body and causes hardening of the arteries which can lead to heart attacks and strokes. I order to prevent problems relating to high cholesterol, the doctor may suggest dieting, exercising, and\/or prescribe cholesterol reducing medications.

The pain in fibromyalgia is not caused by tissue inflammation. Instead, these patients seem to have an increased sensitivity to many different sensory stimuli and an unusually low pain threshold. Minor sensory stimuli that ordinarily would not cause pain in individuals can cause disabling, sometimes severe pain in patients with fibromyalgia. The body pain of fibromyalgia can be aggravated by noise, weather change, and emotional stress. The pain of fibromyalgia is generally widespread, involving both sides of the body. Pain usually affects the neck, buttocks, shoulders, arms, the upper back, and the chest. \"Tender points\" are localized areas of the body that are tender to light touch. Fibromyalgia tender points, or pressure points, are commonly found around the elbows, shoulders, knees, hips, back of the head, and the sides of the breastbone. Fibromyalgia \"tender points\" are sometimes incorrectly referred to as \"trigger points,\" which is terminology that is used to describe a situation whereby pressing on certain trigger points can initiate a sequence of symptoms. This is not the case with fibromyalgia tender points, which are chronically a focus of pain and tenderness in the particular area involved. Fatigue occurs in 90% of patients. Fatigue may be related to abnormal sleep patterns commonly observed in these patients. Normally, there are several levels of depth of sleep. Getting enough of the deeper levels of sleep may be more important in refreshing a person than the total number of hours of sleep. Patients with fibromyalgia lack the deep, restorative level of sleep, called \"non-rapid eye movement\" (non-REM) sleep. Consequently, patients with fibromyalgia often awaken in the morning without feeling fully rested, even though they seem to have had an adequate number of hours of sleep time. Some patients awaken with muscle aches or a sensation of muscle fatigue as if they had been \"working out\" all night! Mental and\/or emotional disturbances occur in over half of people with fibromyalgia. These symptoms include poor concentration, forgetfulness, mood changes, irritability, depression, and anxiety. Since a firm diagnosis of fibromyalgia is difficult and no confirmatory laboratory tests are available, patients with fibromyalgia are often misdiagnosed as having depression as their primary underlying problem. Other symptoms of fibromyalgia include migraine and tension headaches, numbness or tingling of different parts of the body, abdominal pain related to irritable bowel syndrome (\"spastic colon\"), and irritable bladder, causing painful and frequent urination. Like fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome can cause chronic abdominal pain and other bowel disturbances without detectable inflammation of the stomach or the intestines. Each patient with fibromyalgia is unique. Any of the above symptoms can occur intermittently and in different combinations.

We\\'ve learned about neurobiological mechanisms that lead to fibro and ultimately \"rewire\" our central nervous system. ... Here\\'s my list of causes and the % I see. 1. Genetics. I\\'m going to say close to 100% have this \"default\" cause. A number of studies support increased FM in families (ie autosomal dominant, offspring of someone with FM is 8x more likely to have fibro, etc.) or inherited differences in neurotransmitters (serotonin, COMT enzyme, dopamine, mu-opioid receptor, etc,) making one more prone to chronic pain\/FM. I think most everyone with fibro is genetically susceptible to getting it although a different trigger actually may start the fibro \"cascade.\" But up to 40% of my patients may not have another \"trigger\", but simply develop FM over time due to prewired genetics. 2. Trauma. This may be physical or emotional trauma. About 40% of my patients also. This includes whiplash injuries, work injuries, post-surgery fibro, catastrophic stresses (war, loss of loved one, loss of job, etc,) and in this category, a special type of trauma: pregnancy-induced FM. Various researchers in FM including Dr. Romano, Greenfield, Waylonis, Buskila, Wolfe, Clauw have published on FM related to trauma. I see this a lot, unfortunately. Sometimes right before my very eyes and despite my best efforts, a person with a whiplash injury, for example, goes on to develop widespread pain and generalized FM. 3. Inflammatory conditions\/connective tissue disease (lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune disease, polymyalgia rheumatica, etc.) Many people get FM associated with another disease such as these mentioned. These conditions trigger the FM and in this case, the FM may be referred to as reactive FM or secondary FM. This is about 10% of my patients. 4. Infection. A number of patients report they were fine, they got an infection, and it was like hitting a brick wall: they developed fatigue and pain ever since. Examples include mono, mycoplasma, chlamydia, cytomegalovirus, Lymes, and more. I estimate 4% of my patients have this category. 5. Hormone alterations (e.g. hypothroidism, menopause). This is a true \"chicken or egg\" but I\\'m going to say 2% of my patients have this cause. 6. Spinal conditions (e.g. Arnold Chiari malformation, spinal stenosis, arthritis, etc.). We know there is a relationship between cervical spine conditions esp[ecially] leading to FM, and I estimate 2% of my patients have this. 7. Toxic exposures. Chemicals, toxins, vaccines, etc. can trigger an immune reaction and lead to chemical sensitivity syndrome or even FM. 1% of my patients. 8. Other conditions. This category includes peripheral pain syndromes that lead to generalized FM, or neuro conditons like MS or post-polio syndrome that may trigger FM. Many peripheral pain syndromes (like RSD or complex regional pain syndrome) are caused by trauma so if the person gets FM eventually, the cause is really the trauma. Let\\'s call this 1%.

Pellegrino","membervotes":"0"},{"descr":" MD\"","questionId":"1194250","followers":"1911","ans":"Many of us with FM have to work, and we may be faced with a major dilemma: Our fibro interferes with our jobs. This creates stress, often extreme financial stress if the job cannot be performed properly. Whether the FM was caused by a work injury, or whether work is aggravating the pre-existing FM, changes may have to be made in how work is approached to minimize pain and functional impairment. Job considerations: Different factors influence our job abilities. We have a difficult time reaching, using our arms overhead, bending, lifting and being in one position for a long time. We have no business even being in some of the jobs we do since the job duties are so unrealistic for us. Even jobs that involve little or no lifting may not be tolerated if it involves a lot of reaching or repetitions. Some examples of \"high risk\" jobs for us include assembly-line jobs, hairstyling, bus driving, computer work, and cashier jobs. Even sedentary, less physically demanding jobs can be stressful because it\\'s hard to focus, concentrate, and be productive if we hurt all over, have headaches and brain fog etc. We can come up with a list of work things to do that\\'s best for our FM. I mean things that we can modify at work to keep us productive and with minimal pain despite our fibro. Here are some examples of things that you, your doctor, and your therapist can try to do. --Hours: stay on day shift, avoid overtime, can you have a flexible schedule? Decrease commute time? Is part-time more feasible? Can you make up missed time? --Building: Can you park close? Use elevator instead of stairs? --Work environment: Can you control the thermostat? Avoid drafts, bright lights, noise. Minimize interruptions\/disruptions. Is your furniture and work station ergonomically efficient? --Physical: Can you alternate positions? Sit more? Lie down during breaks? Pace your work? --Work load: Can you rotate tasks? Can you prioritize deadlines? Delegate to others? Can you ease pressure on work quotas? Are others depending on your work before they can finish theirs? --Insurance: Is it adequate? Paid medical leave? Pharmacy plan? Reasonable accomodations: The employee, the employer, and the doctor can work together to create a safe workplace with minimal pain, hopefully. The Americans with Disabilities Act requires employers to provide equal employment opportunities for people who are able to do the job but who are limited by physical disabilities. The employee has a right to reasonable accomodations provided by the employer to help overcome any physical limitations. Examples of reasonable accommodations for FM workers might include: --allowing frequent breaks during the workday --rearranging work stations and providing ergonomic tools or furniture to optimize proper body mechanics and use fibronomics. --providing phones with headsets --using a drop keyboard, wrist bars and arm rests on your computer --no direct air conditioning drafts --restrictions on repetitive activities. Family Medical Leave Act: the FMLA was passed to allow workers to take time off work when they (or family members) are incapacitated and require medical treatment for a serious or chronic health condition. I complete these forms often when necessary and will state that FM is a chronic condition that may unpredictably flare up from time to time resulting in impairment of work ability and may require time off work on a temporary basis. We try to prioritize returning to work and staying at work as much as possible.

These tests are done to exclude other possible diagnoses. Therefore, the diagnosis of fibromyalgia is made purely on clinical grounds based on the doctor\\'s history and physical examination. In patients with chronic widespread body pain, the diagnosis of fibromyalgia can be made by identifying point tenderness areas (typically, but not always, patients will have at least 11 of the 18 classic fibromyalgia tender points), by finding no accompanying tissue swelling or inflammation, and by excluding other medical conditions that can mimic fibromyalgia. Many medical conditions can cause pain in different areas of the body, mimicking fibromyalgia. These conditions include: low thyroid hormone levels (hypothyroidism) vitamin D insufficiency parathyroid disease (causing elevated blood calcium level) muscle diseases causing muscle pain (such as polymyositis) bone diseases causing bone pain (such as Paget\\'s disease) elevated blood calcium (hypercalcemia) infectious diseases (such as hepatitis, Epstein Barr virus, AIDS) cancer Again, even though there is no blood test for fibromyalgia, blood tests are important to exclude other medical conditions. Therefore, thyroid hormone and calcium blood levels are obtained to exclude hypercalcemia, hyperparathyroidism, and hypothyroidism. The blood alkaline phosphatase (a bone enzyme) level is often raised in patients with Paget\\'s disease of the bone. The CPK (a muscle enzyme) level is often elevated in patients with polymyositis, a disease with diffuse muscle inflammation. Therefore, obtaining alkaline phosphatase and CPK blood levels can help the doctor decide whether Paget\\'s disease and polymyositis are the causes of bone and muscle pains. A complete blood count (CBC) and liver tests help in the diagnosis of hepatitis and other infections. A blood vitamin D level can detect vitamin D insufficiency. Fibromyalgia can occur alone or in association with other systemic rheumatic conditions. Systemic rheumatic conditions refer to diseases that can cause inflammation and damage to numerous different tissues and organs in the body. Systemic rheumatic conditions associated with fibromyalgia include systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, polymyositis, and polymyalgia rheumatica. Blood tests which are helpful in evaluating these diseases when they are suspected include erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), antinuclear antibody (ANA), and rheumatoid factor (RF). In patients with fibromyalgia without associated systemic illnesses, the ESR, SPEP, ANA, and RF blood tests are usually normal.

School systems have adopted questionable no-nit policies banning kids from walking through the doors if any suspicious white specks are spotted on their scalp. Schools must have a team of Nit Nazis. Insects are taking over our world. Actually, insects outnumber us astronomically, so really we are guests in their world. Dogs get fleas, so we spend millions on ways to eradicate them. Termites are eating our homes. Flies are landing on our dinner plate. Ants and cockroaches show up at night to wander our kitchen looking for morsels and crumbs. Bedbugs are now permanent residents in many fine hotels. Kids  even the cleanest kids from the cleanest homes  can get head lice. I know. My long-haired, daughter brought some home many years ago. Girls are much more social and get head lice more often than boys. I often see sesame-seed sized nits on my little patients. It is rare that I see a live louse scurrying around, but I have seen those as well. I do tend to take a little perverted pleasure in informing a well-coiffed, snooty mother that her little angel is crawling with bugs. Your daughter has head lice. What!! Are you sure? Could it be something else? No. She seems to be harboring a vibrant colony of California scalp-crickets, also known as the common cootie. You probably have them too. Like most of the species on Earth, head lice have adapted to treatments, which range from insecticides like permithrin products (like Nix), Malathion, and sulfa antibiotics to the newly-tested Stromectal  a pill containing ivermectin, a drug used to prevent heartworms in dogs. People do prefer pills to messy hair products, but a heartworm medicine seems like an overkill. Petroleum jelly, mayonnaise, and olive oil are sometimes used in an attempt to suffocate head lice, but these treatments have not been proven to be effective. Too bad, since a kid with a scalp full of mayonnaise or Vaseline is so attractive. There is a lice-smothering product called Ulesfia that does seem to work well, as long as the PETA people dont know you are killing innocent lice. My late grandmother, mother of 15 and self-taught research pharmacologist, used kerosene. Once you kill off the live lice and their egg offspring, the next job is to manually remove the nits. There are all sorts of finetooth nit combs out there and a few substances that claim to dissolve the epoxy-like glue that attaches lice eggs to the hair shaft, but in the end, adults end up just picking them out, one at a time. There may be an evolving market for trained baboons to pick out the eggs and eat them. Lice do not respect social status, so anyone can get them. If your kids bring them home from school, then you will need to go to Def Con 4. The recommendation is to clean everything that can logically be cleaned; however, lice do not exist very long off of the human scalp. Vacuum the carpets and mattresses, but again, lice do not fly and travel too far from the home scalp. It is not necessary to burn down the house and move.

I think most parents go through this at some point with their kids going to school, and the only way to find it is to really look very closely at your child\\'s scalp. So in school it\\'s very hard for these children not to have contact with each other, share brushes, hats, scarves, and that\\'s really how it\\'s spread. So as much as possible, if you can instruct your kid not to share these products with their friends, that would be a great start and a great way to prevent it. But beyond that, you just have to examine your child\\'s scalp very closely. What you will typically find, rather than the active lice, is nits. What nits look like, they really look like flakes of dandruff, except that when you try to remove it, it won\\'t come off the hair, because what the lice do, the nits are the eggs from the lice that will hatch within a week or so, so what the lice do is they create this little capsule, and they glue it to the hair, and that\\'s how it sticks. So it\\'s very hard to take it off. The problem is, I have parents come in and they say, well, but my child would shampoo their scalp everyday. And that makes it worse, because when the hair is that clean, the glue sticks better. So you are almost better off having a greasy scalp, because it\\'s harder for that nit to stick to the scalp. So it\\'s not a matter of cleanliness at all. But once those nits are attached to the scalp, you really have to get a prescription treatment to help get rid of it. There is a prescription called Ovide that you put on to the scalp, leave it on for a few hours, and then shampoo it out, and repeat it in a week to get rid of any nits that might have hatched by then.

Anemia means having a low blood count  a low concentration of red blood cells in the blood. Because red blood cells carry oxygen to the bodys tissues, anemia can cause someone to feel tired, weak, or short of breath. The most common cause of anemia is iron-deficiency anemia. The body needs iron to make hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying substance in red blood cells. Women are often iron-deficient, from losing blood (and iron) during menstruation. Iron-deficiency anemia is usually curable by taking an iron supplement, although the pills can sometimes cause constipation or stomach upset. Anemia due to iron deficiency or blood loss can also be corrected (cured) with a blood transfusion. Nutritional deficiencies such as B12 or folate are also curable causes of anemia. Eating a healthy diet, and possibly taking supplements, will allow the body to naturally build red blood cells back up. There are many other forms of anemia. A few examples include: Anemia associated with chronic diseases (such as kidney disease and cancer) Autoimmune hemolytic anemia Sickle cell anemia Thalassemia Simple blood tests can identify the cause in the vast majority of people with anemia.

Another bean idea is edamame (green soybeans), just a bowl of these can really satisfy your hunger. Basically foods with a lot of soluble fiber or protein and\/or water content help make this happen. Beans are rich in all three. Smart fats can keep the contents in the stomach a little longer too. Foods with monounsaturated fat (olive oil, olives, nuts) and omega-3s (fish, canola oil, walnuts, soy and pecans). Here are some foods rich in soluble fiber: Beans. Oats. Barley -- look for soups with barley! Some fruits (apples, mango, plums, kiwi, pears, blackberries, strawberries, raspberries, peaches, citrus fruits). Some vegetables (artichoke, celery root, sweet potato, parsnip, turnip, acorn squash, potato with skin, Brussel sprouts, cabbage, green peas, broccoli, carrots, cauliflower, asparagus and beets). One of the best pieces of advice for you though, may be to drink some hot tea when you are feeling hungry again, keep some liquid in your stomach and warm liquid tends to hang out in the stomach a little longer, too.

As you may know, gout occurs when uric acid crystals form in the joints resulting in acute and\/or chronic inflammation. Like heart disease, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and abnormal cholesterol levels, gout and high uric acid levels (hyperuricemia) are among the many manifistations of the \"metabolic syndrome\". Following a healthy eating strategy and ambitious exercise program, as one would do to treat or prevent any weight-related medical problem, is a good strategy for gout prevention. The standard medication to prevent gout attacks is allopurinol, which is a \"xanthine oxidase inhibitor\" which inhibits the main enzyme that converts dietary purines into uric acid. Reduced uric acid levels result in reduced frequency of gout attacks. Cherries accomplish something similar in a less potent fashion. The trouble with cherry juice is that meaningful doses come with a troubling amount of sugar. In my view, cherry concetrate without the sugar hardly seems worth the bother when one could take allopurinol.

People with RSV infection may spread \t\t the virus through their secretions (saliva or mucus) when they cough , sneeze, \t\t or talk. You can catch the virus by: Touching an object or surface contaminated with the virus and \t\t\t then touching your nose, eyes , or mouth without first washing your hands. The \t\t\t virus can survive for more than 6 hours on countertops and other hard surfaces, \t\t\t such as doorknobs, and for 30 minutes on hands, clothing, or tissue. Close contact. If an infected person coughs or sneezes near you, \t\t\t you could breathe in RSV that\\'s in his or her saliva or mucus. The virus spreads easily in crowded settings, such as child \t\t care facilities, preschools, churches, and nursing homes. Children attending \t\t school often spread the virus to their parents and siblings. The incubation \t\t period-the time from exposure to RSV until you have symptoms-ranges from 2 to 8 \t\t days, but usually is 4 to 6 days. 1 You \t\t are most likely to spread the virus within the first several days after \t\t symptoms of RSV infection begin.

Recent research suggests that it may be possible to be a carrier of the \t\t virus 3 or 4 months or longer because parts of the virus have been found to \t\t remain in some people long after symptoms have disappeared. 2 Many different viruses, such as the human \t\t metapneumovirus, can cause lower \t\t respiratory tract infections in children. 3 These viruses can cause symptoms that are similar to an RSV \t\t infection.

Human bodys total serotonin is located in the enterochromaffin cells in the GI tract, where it is used to regulate intestinal movements. The remainder is synthesized in serotonergic neurons of the CNS, where it has various functions. These include the regulation of mood, appetite, and sleep. Serotonin also has some cognitive functions, including memory and learning. Modulation of serotonin at synapses is thought to be a major action of several classes of pharmacological antidepressants. Serotonin secreted from the enterochromaffin cells eventually finds its way out of tissues into the blood. There, it is actively taken up by blood platelets, which store it. When the platelets bind to a clot, they release serotonin, where it serves as a vasocnstrictor and helps to regulate hemostasis and blood clotting. Serotonin also is a growth factor for some types of cells, which may give it a role in wound healing. Do hope this is what you want.

If a medical professional has suggested a teenager or young adult take a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( ) for depression, you should ask a lot of questions about the goal of this therapy, possible side effects, and proposed length of time for the child to be on the medication. While SSRIs are generally considered safe for teens and young adults, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2004 issued a warning that SSRIs may cause increased suicidal thoughts in young patients. This warning was based on a review of controlled clinical trial data that showed 4% of teens taking SSRs experienced \"suicidal thoughts or actions.\" Four percent is not a large proportion, but it is twice as high as the percentage of teens taking sugar pills (placebos) who reported feeling suicidal. Any teenager or young adult who is given SSRIs for depression should be closely monitored throughout therapy to ensure their safety. Never be afraid to directly ask a depressed teen, \"Do you ever have thoughts of hurting yourself?\" Trust me, if a teenager is feeling that way he or she will be relieved you\\'re asking. If a teenager reports such feelings, you should immediately contact the medical professional who prescribed the SSRI. It\\'s my personal opinion that teenagers who are given prescriptions for antidepressant medications should also be seeing a therapist. Many studies show that \"talk therapy\" in conjunction with medications presents the best treatment for depression. Just to recap: The benefits of SSRI therapy in teens and young adults likely outweighs the risks involved, but nonetheless keep a close eye on your child who takes antidepressants. Wishing you well!

I have had it myself a few times. My ear pain lasted several days, no matter what I tried to do. When I couldnt hear for a few days, I even visited the audiology department of the university to see if I ruptured my eardrum. I didnt. Several annoying days later, my painful ears returned to normal. When our eustachian tubes fail to regulate that middle ear pressure, pain or at least, pressure will develop. We try to swallow (they usually take your drink away before landing), chew gum (if we have it), or hold our nose and blow called a Valsalva maneuver), but this doesnt always work. If you have a long-standing history of airplane ears, you might take a decongestant before flying, but this, too, doesnt always work. At the American Academy of Pediatrics national conference several years ago, I was introduced to the EarPopper, an electronic device to correct this barometric pressure issue. You simply put the battery-powered blower in one side of your nose, plug the other nostril, and push the button as you swallow. This EarPopper sends air up the Eustachian tubes and equalizes the painful pressure. It works. It can even help kids with middle ear fluid, ear fullness due to colds\/allergies, and those adventuresome people who like to scuba dive. The device is not cheap (about $200), but neither is a trip to your doctor. If you have a child that is on the verge of getting tubes because of middle ear effusion (fluid), then this little device may delay or even eliminate the need for surgery. Tube insertions, although covered by most insurances, costs several thousand dollars. I hadnt thought much about the EarPopper recently, until I got a call from Anya Clowers, RN, who wrote the little book, \"Jet with Kids\"  a brave woman who has traveled to over 16 countries with her child. She had been reading my blog, reading the posting on my Ears, Nose and Throat Community board, and tracked me down. She is an expert on airline safety when it comes to kids. Two enjoyable hours later, we covered the gamut of flying with kids, from picking the best airline seat restraints to using the EarPopper. She loves this device and doesnt leave home without it. We talked about airlines making my Dirty Dozen list as one of the most unsanitary places. You can just about count on kids getting sick when you travel. Not only do kids practice Third World hygiene, they do not have the immune system that can withstand bombardment from the new pathogens they are likely to encounter on the way in the plane, or once they arrive at the destination. Every community has their own variety of circulating germs, and it is those new germs that cause havoc a day or so after you arrive. Parents need to just expect that kids will be getting sick, and stop belly-aching (no pun intended) when the inevitable illness emerges.

These are not surgical instruments, you should not be doing this to your skin. So I do prefer those blackhead removing tools over using your fingers and a tissue. But I also think that this is something that should be done by your dermatologist, in order to have the best chance at extracting the contents of that blackhead without leaving a scar. So anytime you pick at the skin in any way; whether it\\'s using the tool or your fingers, you do have some risk of scarring. So every pimple, blackhead, whitehead, or a pustule, or papule, all starts out as a same thing. Our face is covered with lots of little hair follicles, which are called pores. At the base of those follicles there can be some bacteria that grows as well, called P. acnes. For some reason, which we don\\'t fully understand why that is, the opening of the follicle can become blocked, and that means that all the contents behind it has no place to go, it can\\'t get to the surface. So as it builds up, it can create a little bump on the surface and it can look a little bit white, that\\'s a whitehead. If it opens to the surface, it gets oxidized, and that\\'s a blackhead. So a blackhead isn\\'t dark because it\\'s dirty, it\\'s dark because there is oxidation that goes on and makes it look dark. If there is a P. acnes bacteria that\\'s growing at the base of that follicle, now that the follicle is closed, this kind of bacteria loves an environment where there is no oxygen. So once the covering gets closed, there is no more oxygen, the bacteria wakes up, and it has all this great food; its got the oils from the oil glands that are produced there, and all the proteins from the skin cells that are clogged behind it. And now its got an abundance of food supplies, so it starts to flourish, and that can look like a pimple. So when you pick at it, what you do is you create an inflammatory response, which makes it red and angry and can make it more likely to persist or last longer and more likely to scar, and more likely to come back in the same spot, so picking is very bad. But your dermatologist can help extract that for you, or give you a treatment, like a retinoid or a topical antibiotic, that can get rid of that pimple for you much more quickly and safely.

We treat them like family members, and in many ways, we treat them better than people. But can they cause you misery where you least expect it? Yes, indeed. Snoring pooches in our bed can wreak havoc on our sleep. And were not always as inclined to kick them out as we would a snoring spouse. I was reminded about the trials of sleeping with a snoring dog when I read an amusing blog called Fully Vetted. The author and veterinarian Patty Khuly, brought up a few interesting points: * If you suffer from insomnia aside from your snoring bed partner, then your problems finding sleep are even more challenging  especially if you awaken in the middle of the night and cant get back to sleep, thanks to the nasally roar of your neighbor. * The same physical issues experienced by humans when they snore (airway obstruction) must also affect snoring dogs. Dogs who snore are almost certainly experiencing some degree of respiratory compromise that affects their waking lives, too. (So yes, I guess dogs can be victims of sleep apnea just like humans.) * But unlike humans, dogs dont sweat; they regulate their body temperature through panting  using their tongue and airway as a cooling mechanism. Dogs who are unable to move air efficiently are not only more likely to suffer heat stress, theyre also less likely to move enough air into their bodies to oxygenate their blood efficiently. Which helps explain why snore-prone breeds can suffer from chronic fatigue. * Dogs that endure a lifetime of poor breathing can end up getting hiatal hernias, which can be life-threatening. So yes, something as seemingly harmless as snoring can instigate other health troubles that create a domino effect down a dangerous path. But then again, the same can be said for humans who snore due to something like obstructive sleep apnea, which can trigger respiratory and circulatory distress farther down the line. All this brings to mind a recent headline about dogs who die while traveling on planes. It turns out that short-snouted dogs are most likely to die on planesbulldogs, pugs and similar breeds made up about half of deaths in past 5 years. Short-nosed breeds  known as brachycephalic in the dog world  have a skull formation that affects their airways. They cant cool themselves off so easily and are prone to heat distress and, in severe cases, death. Luckily, humans [all] have similarly shaped nasal passages. What distinguishes those who snore and may suffer health consequences from those who dont is usually related to something other than the shape of ones nose. Body weight (especially neck circumference) is one such factor. The thicker your neck, the higher your risk for snoring among other health challenges. But its interesting how the problems that plague our four-legged friends arent all that different. Dogs and humans share more than meets the eye. In addition to sharing beds, they can share a bad nights sleep. Which is why I always advocate that people and pets keep separate bunks. And watch out: letting your pet have a piece of your slumbering space might be a hard habit to break once theyve gotten used to it. Something else to keep in mind: your allergies. Over time its quite easy to develop allergies to pets and not realize it. If you wake with a stuffy nose every day, put Fido or Fluffy in their own space. While that may mean off the bed, it could just mean a special space on the bed that they can call their own. This way you both can get a good nights rest.

If you share your bed with your pet, however, you may want to reconsider. Sharing your bed with your pets can interfere with sleep, but it can be very hard for us to deny our beloved pets the opportunity to curl up in our beds. Pets are like family members, and we dont like to exclude them from snuggling with us when they show so much affection and beg to be with us at night. However, dogs and cats are just as likely to snore as your human bed partner, and are much more likely to wake you during their nightly grooming rituals. Allowing your cat or dog to sleep next to you may be harmful to more than just your sleep. A recent article suggests that letting your pets sleep in your bed or excessively lick your face can lead to your getting diseases and parasites. These conclusions are based on a study done by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), which claims that over half of people with pets allow them to sleep in their beds. Interestingly, the study also suggests that women are more likely than men to let pets sleep in their beds. Weve always known that dogs and cats are carriers for fleas and ticks, but some of the diseases and parasites outlined in the study are downright gross: MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), meningitis  even the plague! These diseases are classified as zoonoses, as they are diseases or infections transmitted from animals to humans - if youre having trouble sleeping, the last thing you need are nightmares about zoonoses! This is not to say that you should start looking at your dog or cat as the harbinger of the bubonic plague  I have two dogs and a cat, and my human family and I could never stop loving the members of our animal family. But I do advocate that people and pets have separate sleeping arrangements, no matter how hard it is to convince your pet that he or she is no longer welcome in the bed. If you have allergies, sleeping in a separate room than your pet may help with those, as well. If you arent getting a good nights sleep, chances are high the dog next to you isnt either  bunk beds may be the healthier option for both of you.

The answer is yes, malaria can return. Cerebral malaria has a very high mortality rate (about 20%), and\t\tit is usually caused by the plasmodium falciparum type of malaria. Benign malaria has a very low mortality and is caused by the\t\tthree other types of plasmodium protozoan which are transmitted via anopheles\t\tmosquito bites. The incubation period for these is longer than with falciparum;\t\tin 5-10% of cases the malaria presents more than a year after infection.\t\t The initial symptoms of acute illness may be \\'flu-like\\' with\t\tsome or all of the following symtoms: sudden coldness, headache, muscle pains,\t\thigh fever, flushing, vomiting and drenching sweats. Any of the four types of malaria may produce a similar illness\t\tinitially. Relapse occurs as parasites may lie dormant in the liver for very\t\tlong intervals. If you have the slightest suspicion that you are having a\t\trelapse, you must alert your doctor to your past medical history so that you\t\tcan be tested as a matter of some urgency.

But let me explain further. Neutrophilia is the medical term for an abundance of normal white blood cells in the system. \"Acute\" simply means the high blood cell count is a short-term or temporary event. Neutrophilia is often called a \"high white cell count.\" Usually, a high white cell count indicates the individual\\'s body is responding to an infection, since that\\'s the primary role of white blood cells in the system. However, any type of inflammation can raise the white cell count, including a heart attack or a bad burn. In , the bone marrow produces an overabundance of white cells, called leukemia cells. These cells are not normal white cells and do not act like normal white cells. For example, leukemia cells do not fight bacterial infections the way normal white blood cells do. If you and your sister are concerned about her diagnosis, your best bet is to have a discussion with her health care provider about what her diagnosis means and what may have caused her white blood cell count to go up. If this is garden-variety neutrophilia, the chances are her white count will normalize gradually. I hope this helps!

You don\\'t say if you\\'re asking on behalf of an adult or a child. Constipation in children can have a psychological component, so your best bet is to consult your pediatrician. For adults, the two components of maintaining healthy bowel habits are fiber and water. Eat plenty of fresh vegetables and fruits, and drink plenty of water. And don\\'t fool yourself that soda, coffee, tea, energy drinks or other types of beverages are \"as good as water because they\\'re mostly water anyway.\" You need plenty of plain H2O in your life. If you\\'re already eating plenty of fiber-rich foods and still have problems with constipation, make sure you go to the bathroom when you first feel the urge for a bowel movement. Many people hate to interrupt their activities to poop, but holding your stool can lead to constipation. If necessary, try scheduling a bathroom trip every couple of hours until you get regular again. However, do not try to force yourself to have a bowel movement each time you make that scheduled trip. The idea is just to give you the opportunity to go if the urge arises while you\\'re on the toilet. Straining to eliminate stool can lead to hemorrhoids and other problems. Try not to use , as routine laxative use can actually make constipation worse. That said, it\\'s OK to occasionally rely on a fiber laxative or a plain stool softener (without a stimulant), such as docusate, for acute bouts of constipation. I\\'d also suggest you discuss your chronic constipation with your health care provider at your next checkup. Occasionally, constipation can be a sign of an underlying health issue, so it\\'s an important thing to tell your doctor or primary care provider about. Wishing you well!

Before I get to your questions about HPV, let\\'s back up for just a moment. An abnormal Pap smear does not necessarily indicate you have (HPV). The Pap test specifically screens women for cervical cancer. An abnormal Pap result does not mean you have cervical cancer. In fact, most abnormal Pap test results are not cancer at all. Certainly HPV can cause cervical cancer. However, you need to receive a special test (not unlike a Pap test, actually) in which the cells of your cervix are tested for HPV. In answer to your question, HPV is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases. The Centers for Disease Control estimate as many as 50% of sexually active men and women get HPV at some point in their lives. Often, people who are infected with it have no symptoms. So, while it\\'s not exactly true to say HPV can lie dormant in your system, it is accurate to say you can be infected with HPV and live with it for many years without knowing it. Your gynecologist probably will want to discuss your abnormal Pap test result with you. When that happens, you will have the opportunity to discuss your concerns about HPV.

Instead, it just may be that baby is at a stage when shes colicky. So instead of changing babys formula all around, youd really do better to talk to your pediatrician. Thats because intolerance to the baby formula is much less likely than colic, for which we have no known cause -- or cure. So instead of parents agonizing about the formula, they probably just need to wait until baby outgrows the colic, which is usually at about three months. Another common bottle-feeding problem is the way parents position babies: Some lie them completely flat, which can make babies choke when feeding on the bottle. So be sure to have your baby semi-inclined or upright. Another common mistake is propping the bottle. Dont prop babys bottle; it can be a choking hazard. That is also why you should also always be present when baby is feeding, even when shes old enough to hold her own bottle. ... The main thing: Do lots of trial-and-error to be sure you find a bottle and nipple combination that works for your child. So dont stock up on too many of the same kind of bottles unless you know your child is going to take it well. Actually, the same goes for formula, diapers, and all baby things: [Dont stock up] unless you know your baby is adjusted to that type or brand.

I know it\\'s hard when you have a good routine going, but babies are changing fast. So go with the early bedtime but make sure you get a good feed in before putting him down. Remember at this age babies usually can\\'t stay up for more than 2 hours during the day. So look for those tired signs after he gets up in the morning and put him down for a morning nap. Do the same about 2 hours after the morning nap and then the same in the afternoon. By 6 months, most babies can stay up a bit longer and typically take 2 naps, one in the early morning and one in the afternoon. If he is hungry, he will wake to feed but should go back down. During growth spurts, which typically occur at 3 and 6 months, babies will wake and feed more often. When the growth spurt is over they will go back to more predictable feeding times. Always trust that your baby knows when to be fed and respond appropriately. As for timing of feedings, typically by 4 months they get quicker at eating but all babies are different. I\\'m not sure if you\\'re breastfeeding or bottle feeding so it\\'s tough to say.

In some cases, premature and inhibited ejaculation are caused by a lack of attraction for a partner, past traumatic events, and psychological factors, including a strict religious background that causes the person to view sex as sinful. Premature ejaculation, the most common form of sexual dysfunction in men, often is due to nervousness over how well he will perform during sex. Certain drugs, including some antidepressants, may affect ejaculation, as can nerve damage to the spinal cord or back. Retrograde ejaculation is common in males with diabetes who suffer from diabetic neuropathy (nerve damage). This is due to problems with the nerves in the bladder and the bladder neck that allow the ejaculate to flow backward and into the bladder. In other men, retrograde ejaculation occurs after operations on the bladder neck or prostate, or after certain abdominal operations.

Let me explain a little bit about lab results and why they can be hard to interpret. \"Lab work\" generally refers to blood analysis. You go in, someone takes a vial or two of blood, and then these samples are analyzed for various components. Depending on the testing your health care provider ordered, the blood may be analyzed for cell counts (white, red, etc.), vitamins like potassium, and\/or hormones like thyroid. Scientists have established \"reference ranges\" to determine the normal values of each of these blood components. They set these ranges by analyzing the blood of healthy people and then averaging the results. So, for example, the normal reference range for potassium in an adult is 3.5 to 5.1. (We won\\'t get into the unit of measure because it\\'s too complicated to explain here.) Let\\'s say your potassium level was 5.2. That would get flagged on the lab paperwork as a \"high\" potassium level. But it\\'s doubtful your doctor would treat this. By the same token, maybe your potassium tested at 3.2. Again, that would get flagged as a \"low potassium\" result, but your health care provider may or may not treat it. This is why I began by saying only your health care provider can determine whether or not your \"high\" potassium level is something to be concerned about. If it is, then he or she will take the appropriate steps to treat the problem.

High blood pressure (hypertension), heart failure, heart rhythm disturbances, atherosclerotic heart disease, pulmonary hypertension, insulin resistance, and even death are some of the known complications of untreated obstructive sleep apnea. High blood pressure Sleep apnea causes high blood pressure and heart problems. Cessation of breathing frequently during the night (every 1-4 minutes) can cause increased stress on the heart. As the oxygen saturation in the blood decreases and the apnea continues, the sympathetic nervous system (responsible for the \"fight or flight\" response of the body) is activated. This fight or flight response sends nerve signals to the blood vessels to constrict (tighten up) and to the heart to work harder. When the vessels constrict, more blood is sent to the brain and muscles. However, this increases the blood pressure, which requires the heart to work harder to pump blood through the smaller caliber vessels. That, combined with the signal for the heart to work harder and the lower available oxygen in the blood from apnea, causes increased stress on the heart throughout the night. During sleep is normally the time when the heart has less work to do and can \"rest.\" Among patients with obstructive sleep apnea that do not have high blood pressure, 45% will develop high blood pressure within four years. If you examine patients who have hard-to-control blood pressure, that is, taking more than one medicine for control, 80% have obstructive sleep apnea. When the obstructive sleep apnea is treated blood pressure decreases. Heart complications The risk for congestive heart failure increases by 2.3 times and the risk of stroke by 1.5 times with obstructive sleep apnea. Obstructive sleep apnea can complicate the treatment of atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is a condition in which the upper part of the heart (atrium) is beating out of coordination with the lower part (ventricle). The treatment is to cardiovert the heart (resetting the atrium and allowing it to synchronize with the ventricle). After cardioversion, 50% of patients have a recurrence of atrial fibrillation, but patients with obstructive sleep apnea have an 80% recurrence. Finally, obstructive sleep apnea can increase the risk of sudden death. Sudden death can kill not only the patient but also their loved ones, for example, if they are driving a car when the death occurs.

There are three types of \t\t\t glaucoma. Open-angle glaucoma is the most common \t\t\t\tform in the United States. In this type of glaucoma, the optic nerve is damaged \t\t\t\tbit by bit. This slowly leads to loss of eyesight. One eye may be affected more \t\t\t\tthan the other. Sometimes much of your eyesight may be lost before you notice \t\t\t\tit. Closed-angle glaucoma is less common. \t\t\t\tAbout 10% of all glaucoma cases in the United States are closed-angle. In this \t\t\t\ttype of glaucoma, the colored part of the eye (iris) and the lens block \t\t\t\tmovement of fluid between the chambers of your eye. This causes pressure to \t\t\t\tbuild up and the iris to press on the drainage system of the eye. (See a \t\t\t\tpicture of the \t\t\t\t iris and lens .) A related type is sudden (acute) closed-angle glaucoma. It is \t\t\t\toften an emergency. If you get this acute form, you will need medical care \t\t\t\tright away to prevent permanent damage to your eye. Congenital glaucoma is a rare form of \t\t\t\tglaucoma that some infants have at birth. Some children and young adults can \t\t\t\talso get a type of the disease. Finding and treating glaucoma early is important to \t\t\t prevent blindness. If you are at high risk for the disease, be sure to get \t\t\t checked by an eye specialist ( ophthalmologist ) even if you have no \t\t\t symptoms. Your risk for glaucoma rises after age 40 and even more \t\t\t quickly after age 70. Race is also a factor. Blacks are more likely than whites \t\t\t to get the disease. You are also at risk if you have diabetes or if a close \t\t\t family member has had glaucoma.

Congestive heart failure can be caused by: The heart has two atria (right atrium and left atrium) that make up the upper chambers of the heart, and two ventricles (left ventricle and right ventricle) that make up the lower chambers of the heart. The ventricles are muscular chambers that pump blood when the muscles contract. The contraction of the ventricle muscles is called systole. Many diseases can impair the pumping action of the ventricles. For example, the muscles of the ventricles can be weakened by heart attacks or infections (myocarditis). The diminished pumping ability of the ventricles due to muscle weakening is called systolic dysfunction. After each ventricular contraction (systole) the ventricle muscles need to relax to allow blood from the atria to fill the ventricles. This relaxation of the ventricles is called diastole. Diseases such as hemochromatosis (iron overload) or amyloidosis can cause stiffening of the heart muscle and impair the ventricles\\' capacity to relax and fill; this is referred to as diastolic dysfunction. The most common cause of this is longstanding high blood pressure resulting in a thickened (hypertrophied) heart. Additionally, in some patients, although the pumping action and filling capacity of the heart may be normal, abnormally high oxygen demand by the body\\'s tissues (for example, with hyperthyroidism or anemia) may make it difficult for the heart to supply an adequate blood flow (called high output heart failure). In some individuals one or more of these factors can be present to cause congestive heart failure. The remainder of this article will focus primarily on congestive heart failure that is due to heart muscle weakness, systolic dysfunction. Congestive heart failure can affect many organs of the body. For example: The weakened heart muscles may not be able to supply enough blood to the kidneys, which then begin to lose their normal ability to excrete salt (sodium) and water. This diminished kidney function can cause the body to retain more fluid. The lungs may become congested with fluid (pulmonary edema) and the person\\'s ability to exercise is decreased. Fluid may likewise accumulate in the liver, thereby impairing its ability to rid the body of toxins and produce essential proteins. The intestines may become less efficient in absorbing nutrients and medicines. Fluid also may accumulate in the extremities, resulting in edema (swelling) of the ankles and feet. Eventually, untreated, worsening congestive heart failure will affect virtually every organ in the body.

The course of the disease in any given individual, however, is extremely variable. Factors involved in determining the long term outlook (prognosis) for a given patient include: the nature of the underlying heart disease the response to medications the degree to which other organ systems are involved and the severity of other accompanying conditions the person\\'s symptoms and degree of impairment other factors that remain poorly understood With the availability of newer drugs to potentially favorably affect the progression of disease, the prognosis in congestive heart failure is generally more favorable than that observed just 10 years ago. In some cases, especially when the heart muscle dysfunction has recently developed, a significant spontaneous improvement is not uncommonly observed, even to the point where heart function becomes normal. Heart failure is often graded on a scale of I to IV based on the patient\\'s ability to function. The prognosis of heart failure patients is very closely associated with the functional class. An important issue in congestive heart failure is the risk of heart rhythm disturbances (arrhythmias). Of those deaths that occur in individuals with congestive heart failure, approximately 50% are related to progressive heart failure. Importantly, the other half are thought to be related to serious arrhythmias. A major advance has been the finding that nonsurgical placement of automatic implantable cardioverter\/defibrillators (AICD) in individuals with severe congestive heart failure (defined by an ejection fraction below 30%-35%) can significantly improve survival, and has become the standard of care in most such individuals. In some people with severe heart failure and certain ECG abnormalities, the left and right side of the heart don\\'t beat in rhythm, and inserting a device called a biventricular pacer can significantly reduce symptoms.

It can also cause headaches and gastrointestinal complications such as abdominal pain and nausea. Because cocaine tends to decrease appetite, chronic users can become malnourished, as well. Different methods of taking cocaine can produce different adverse effects. Regularly snorting cocaine, for example, can lead to loss of the sense of smell, nosebleeds, problems with swallowing, hoarseness, and a chronically runny nose. Ingesting cocaine can cause severe bowel gangrene as a result of reduced blood flow. Injecting cocaine can bring about severe allergic reactions and increased risk for contracting HIV and other blood-borne diseases. Binge patterns of use may lead to irritability, restlessness, anxiety, and paranoia. Cocaine abusers can suffer a temporary state of full-blown paranoid psychosis, in which they lose touch with reality and experience auditory hallucinations. Regardless of how or how frequently cocaine is used, a user can experience acute cardiovascular or cerebrovascular emergencies, such as a heart attack or stroke, which may cause sudden death. Cocaine-related deaths are often a result of cardiac arrest or seizure followed by respiratory arrest. Added Danger: Cocaethylene When people consume cocaine and alcohol together, they compound the danger each drug poses and unknowingly perform a complex chemical experiment within their bodies. Researchers have found that the human liver combines cocaine and alcohol to produce a third substance, cocaethylene, which intensifies cocaine\\'s euphoric effects. Cocaethylene is associated with a greater risk of sudden death than cocaine alone. 1 ","votes":"38","membertype":null,"helpful":"30","title":"What adverse effects does cocaine have on health?","url":"http:\/\/answers.webmd.com\/answers\/1176325\/what-adverse-effects-does-cocaine-have","membername":null,"membervotes":null},{"descr":null,"questionId":"1176322","followers":null,"ans":"Behavioral interventions -- particularly, cognitive-behavioral therapy -- have been shown to be effective for decreasing cocaine use and preventing relapse.

First Visit: Examining and preparing the tooth. At the first visit in preparation for a crown, your dentist may take a few X-rays to check the roots of the tooth receiving the crown and surrounding bone. If the tooth has extensive decay or if there is a risk of infection or injury to the tooth\\'s pulp, a root canal treatment may first be performed. Before the process of making your crown is begun, your dentist will anesthetize (numb) your tooth and the gum tissue around the tooth. Next, the tooth receiving the crown is filed down along the chewing surface and sides to make room for the crown. The amount removed depends on the type of crown used (for instance, all-metal crowns are thinner, requiring less tooth structure removal than all-porcelain or porcelain-fused-to-metal ones). If, on the other hand, a large area of the tooth is missing (due to decay or damage), your dentist will use filling material to \"build up\" the tooth to support the crown. After reshaping the tooth, your dentist will use impression paste or putty to make an impression of the tooth to receive the crown. Impressions of the teeth above and below the tooth to receive the dental crown will also be made to make sure that the crown will not affect your bite. The impressions are sent to a dental laboratory where the crown will be manufactured. The crown is usually returned to your dentist\\'s office in 2 to 3 weeks. If your crown is made of porcelain, your dentist will also select the shade that most closely matches the color of the neighboring teeth. During this first office visit your dentist will make a temporary crown to cover and protect the prepared tooth while the crown is being made. Temporary crowns usually are made of acrylic and are held in place using a temporary cement. Second Visit: Receiving the permanent dental crown. At your second visit, your dentist will remove your temporary crown and check the fit and color of the permanent crown. If everything is acceptable, a local anesthetic will be used to numb the tooth and the new crown is permanently cemented in place.

In order to determine whether bleeding is abnormal, and its cause, the doctor must consider three questions: Is the woman pregnant? What is the pattern of the bleeding? Is she ovulating? Every woman who thinks she has an irregular menstrual bleeding pattern should think carefully about the specific characteristics of her vaginal bleeding in order to help her doctor evaluate her particular situation. Her doctor will require the details of her menstrual history. Each category of menstrual disturbance has a particular list of causes, necessary testing, and treatment. 1. Is the woman having abnormal vaginal bleeding during pregnancy? Much of the abnormal vaginal bleeding during pregnancy occurs so early in the pregnancy that the woman doesn\\'t realize she is pregnant. Therefore, irregular bleeding that is new may be a sign of very early pregnancy, even before a woman is aware of her condition. Vaginal bleeding during pregnancy can also be associated with complications of pregnancy, such as miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy. 2. What is the pattern of the abnormal vaginal bleeding? The duration, interval, and amount of vaginal bleeding may suggest what type of abnormality is responsible for the bleeding. An abnormal duration of menstrual bleeding can be either bleeding for too long of a period ( hypermenorrhea ), or too short of a period ( hypomenorrhea ). The interval of the bleeding can be abnormal in several ways. A woman\\'s menstrual periods can occur too frequently ( polymenorrhea ) or too seldom ( oligomenorrhea ). Additionally, the duration can vary excessively from cycle to cycle ( metrorrhagia ). The amount (volume) of bleeding can also be abnormal. A woman can either have too much bleeding ( menorrhagia ) or too little volume ( hypomenorrhea ). The combination of excessive bleeding combined with bleeding outside of the expected time of menstruation is referred to as menometrorrhagia . 3. Is the woman ovulating? Usually, the ovary releases an egg every month in a process called ovulation. Normal ovulation is necessary for regular menstrual periods. There are certain clues that a woman is ovulating normally including regular menstrual intervals, vaginal mucus discharge halfway between menstrual cycles, and monthly symptoms including breast tenderness, fluid retention, menstrual cramps, back pain, and mood changes. If necessary, doctors will order hormone blood tests (progesterone level), daily home body temperature testing, or rarely, a sampling of the lining of the uterus (endometrial sampling) to determine whether or not a woman is ovulating normally. On the other hand, signs that a woman is not ovulating regularly include prolonged bleeding at irregular intervals after not having a menstrual period for several months, excessively low blood progesterone levels in the second half of the menstrual cycle, and lack of the normal body temperature fluctuation during the time of expected ovulation. Sometimes, a doctor determines that a woman is not ovulating by using endometrial sampling with biopsy.

As a matter of fact, these cancers frequently are first detected by an abnormality on a blood test (the PSA) or as a hard nodule (lump) in the prostate gland. Occasionally, the doctor may first feel a hard nodule during a routine digital (done with the finger) rectal examination. The prostate gland is located immediately in front of the rectum. Rarely, in more advanced cases, the cancer may enlarge and press on the urethra. As a result, the flow of urine diminishes and urination becomes more difficult. Patients may also experience burning with urination or blood in the urine. As the tumor continues to grow, it can completely block the flow of urine, resulting in a painfully obstructed and enlarged urinary bladder. These symptoms by themselves, however, do not confirm the presence of prostate cancer. Most of these symptoms can occur in men with non-cancerous (benign) enlargement of the prostate (the most common form of prostate enlargement). However, the occurrence of these symptoms should prompt an evaluation by the doctor to rule out cancer and provide appropriate treatment. Furthermore, in the later stages, prostate cancer can spread locally into the surrounding tissue or the nearby lymph nodes, called the pelvic nodes. The cancer then can spread even farther (metastasize) to other areas of the body. Symptoms of metastatic disease include fatigue, malaise, and weight loss. During a rectal examination, the doctor can sometimes detect local spread into the surrounding tissues. That is, the physician can feel a hard, fixed (not moveable) tumor extending from and beyond the gland. Prostate cancer usually metastasizes first to the lower spine or the pelvic bones (the bones connecting the lower spine to the hips), thereby causing back or pelvic pain. The cancer can then spread to the liver and lungs. Metastases (areas to which the cancer has spread) to the liver can cause pain in the abdomen and jaundice (yellow color of the skin) in rare instances. Metastases to the lungs can cause chest pain and coughing.

But there are several risk factors for the disease. Other diseases. Colorectal cancer is strongly associated with certain other diseases. Those people considered at high risk include anyone with a personal or family history of colon polyps, inflammatory disease of the colon such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn\\'s disease, and cancers of the pancreas, breast, ovaries, or uterus. Heredity. As with any cancer, susceptibility to colorectal cancer is at least partly determined by genetic makeup. A few people inherit medical conditions, such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), MYH-associated polyposis (MAP), Gardner\\'s syndrome, Turcot\\'s syndrome, Peutz-Jagher\\'s syndrome, juvenile polyposis, and Cowden\\'s disease. In all of these disorders, colon polyps develop at an early age and unless treated, these people are almost certain to develop colorectal cancer. Hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer. The disease extends from generation to generation and causes a person to develop colon cancer at a young age with up to 100 colon polyps (which is why it\\'s called non-polyposis). This disease is associated with other cancers including endometrial, small bowel, upper urinary tract, bladder, ovary, stomach, bile duct, skin, and some pancreatic cancers. This is known as the Lynch Syndrome. Diet. Diet also contributes to the risk of colorectal cancer, although the cause-and-effect relationship is still unclear. People whose diets are high in fruits and vegetables seem to have a reduced risk. Many studies implicate animal fat and protein as promoters of colorectal cancer, although researchers are cautious about drawing any definite conclusions. Some studies show that regularly eating red meat, which is rich in saturated fat and protein, increases risk, while others find no connection. Some scientists think that fat is the main culprit, while others suspect protein. Others contend that it\\'s not the fat and protein themselves, but the way they are cooked. They note that fats and protein cooked at high temperatures -- especially when broiled and barbecued -- can produce a host of potentially carcinogenic substances linked to colorectal cancer. Chemical exposure. Heavy exposure to certain chemicals, including chlorine -- which in small amounts is commonly used to purify drinking water -- may increase the risk of colorectal cancer. Exposure to asbestos is thought to be potentially harmful because it has been implicated in causing formation of polyps in the colon. History of certain types of surgery. Surgeries like ureterosigmoidostomy, which is performed in the treatment of bladder cancer, and a cholecsytecomy (the removal of the gallbladder). The ladder has been implicated as a risk for colon cancer development in some studies, but not in others. History of colon cancer. A prior case of colon cancer increases the risk of a second colon cancer, especially if the first cancer was diagnosed before the age of 60. Lifestyle. Smoking and alcohol intake of more than 4 drinks per week increases the risk of developing colon cancer. Family history. Those with a first-degree relative with colorectal cancer have an increased risk of the disease. The risk increases if more than one first-degree relative has colon cancer. Radiation. Prior radiation increases the risk of cancer to the radiated tissue only.

We can reduce our risk by as much as 24% if we just get up and get moving. Aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs also protect against CRC. Statins (medication that lowers cholesterol) may affect CRC in a positive way. Postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy was shown in the Womens Health Initiative study to reduce the incidence of CRC. Dietary calcium, magnesium, fish oils, and vitamin B6 all have positive effects in reducing CRC. And non-herbal tea and possibly coffee, a diet high in fruits and vegetables and low in red and processed meats may all be protective against CRC. Antioxidants, folic acid, and a diet high in fiber have not been shown to aid in preventing cancer of the colon and rectum. But the following have been shown to increase our risk: obesity, alcohol, cigarette smoking, diabetes and being insulin resistant. Drinking more than 45 grams per day of alcohol increases a persons life risk for colorectal cancer. If a persons body mass index (BMI) is over 25, there is a 1.5 fold increase in their risk. Researchers also noted an increase in incidence of CRC, and death from CRC if a person smoked. And in another study that compared those with diabetes and non-diabetics, the risk of CRC was 30% higher for the diabetic group. Another factor that increases a persons risk for CRC is inflammatory bowel disease, such as ulcerative colitis or Crohns disease. Inflammation throughout the GI tract may be the culprit, which explains why aspirin and anti-inflammatory drugs seem to protect against CRC. Finally, if you have a family history of colorectal cancer, you must be observed closely by your doctor.

Estrogen is commonly associated with weight gain. But which begets the other? Does the fat cause the estrogen, or is it the other way around? Its both. First, fat cells beget estrogen production. But then elevated estrogen levels further slow down metabolism, such that estrogen plays a role in convincing a body to store more weight. For many, this becomes a vicious cycle of accelerating weight gain. The mechanism by which estrogen causes weight gain is through inhibiting thyroid function. In a normal-weight woman, estrogen and thyroid hormone play off of each other in an intricate balance. Yet when a woman becomes overweight, her estrogen levels drive her thyroid function relentlessly downward. With impaired thyroid function, a woman can feel sluggish and fatigued, and therefore expend less energy, and also subconsciously down-regulate her metabolism such that her body is burning less and less fuel to get by and she is not even aware of it. Up to 10 percent of American women have issues with hypothyroidism. The enzyme by which a cell converts testosterone into estrogen is called aromatase. Aromatase is the primary source of estrogen in men, as it converts testosterone to estrogen within cells. Aromatase enzymes are present in all types of tissue, yet the aromatase expressed in adipose tissue accounts for the vast majority of non-ovarian estrogen production in men and in women. This is why, in fact, many women suffer estrogen-deficiency symptoms when they lose too much weight. Additionally, the aromatization of testosterone to estrogen increases as a function of body weight and advancing age. This is a problem for men, as well as another compounding factor for menopausal women. It can also lead fairly quickly to estrogen dominance, which causes its own slew of reproductive problems.

Most critical, and far more important than the total word count, is the overall development of the child. A baby whos lagging a bit on spoken word skills, but is otherwise developmentally normal, has an excellent prognosis and will catch up. However, a baby who is otherwise not developing typicallysay, with lagging motor skills, or lacking appropriate social-interacting skillsis of far more concern, and ought to be referred to evaluation and therapy quickly. Parents should also be mindful of potential risk factors. Children with hearing or other sensory deficits are certainly at risk for more longstanding speech issues, as are children with cleft lip or other facial anomalies or neurologic problems. Premature babies or babies with chronic health issues are also more likely to need therapy to help catch up. Finally, parents should look at the progress that their children are making on their own. If your daughter is behind in speech skills, ask yourself, How much improvement has she made in the last month? A child whos making progress and gaining skills on her own is likely to continue to gain skills, and catch up. Concern should be very much increased, though, if a child is lagging and seems to have hit a plateau.

Well, it depends on who you ask. But the common consensus is that if you regularly come to a climax too early during sex without fulfilling your partner, you may be one of many men who are suffering from premature ejaculation (PE). As many as one in three men are believed to be afflicted with this sexual dysfunction. Actual figures may actually be higher as this is an embarrassing ailment that not many guys are willing to openly discuss. What are the symptoms of premature ejaculation? Premature ejaculation can be categorized by lifelong (primary) or acquired (secondary). The former can be characterized by early ejaculation within one minute following intercourse. This is often accompanied by a severe lack of confidence in bed and in worst cases, an avoidance of sex altogether. On the other hand, secondary PE is often marked by persistent ejaculation before both you and your partner wish that it happens. Guys who are experiencing secondary PE usually have enjoyed fulfilling sexual relationships in the past. Are you at risk? There are some men who are at higher risks of developing premature ejaculation. These include guys who are suffering from some form of erectile dysfunction. Men who have problems with erection often subconsciously hurry through sexual intercourse for fear of losing their erections. One of the biggest contributors to early ejaculation is stress or emotional strain. So men who are often emotionally stressed out are at a higher risk of ejaculating early during sex. This is nature\\'s way of releasing tension that has been pent up. Do you need to seek medical attention? If your lack of sexual endurance is causing great distress to you and your partner, it is recommended that you seek medical assistance. The doctor would be able to advice on the appropriate treatment to help you cope with the problem. In some cases, the doctor will even suggest that you are not even experiencing early ejaculation, especially if it occurs only occasionally. Likewise, if you can satisfy your partner even if you do not last more than 2 to 4 minutes during intercourse, there is no real cause for concern. Coping with premature ejaculation There are many forms of treatments, and what you choose to use will depend on the severity of your condition. These options include natural sexual therapy and conditioning, such as the squeeze technique to re-wire your ejaculatory triggers; medications that include the use of anti-depressants or topical anesthetic creams or sprays. The bottom line is, premature ejaculation is very common and is a treatable condition. By understanding why you are ejaculating prematurely, you can use the appropriate solutions to permanently end your ejaculation problems and achieve the coveted ability to enjoy long-lasting sex!

Sometimes the problem is a shortened period before ejaculation because of the need for prolonged stimulation to achieve an erection. Premature ejaculation is more common in younger men and often resolves with increasing experience. Anxiety often plays a role. Psychological and drug therapy with sertraline can be effective, but reported success rates are conflicting, which suggests that the benefits are not maintained.

Despite being of one the most common serious genetic disorders, few people know about FH unless their life is affected in some way. The prevalence of FH is 1 in 300 to 500 in many populations. There are over 620,000 FH patients currently living in the United States. Many of these people are unaware that their risk of premature coronary heart disease is elevated about 20-fold in patients that have not been treated. There are two different types of FH patients. The most serious type is called the homozygous form. This means that the genetic defect was inherited from both parents. Homozygous FH type occurs in 1 out of every 1,000,000 individuals and is associated with the rapid and premature development of coronary heart disease in childhood or adolescence. Many of these patients never live to see their second or third decade of life. The heterozygous form of FH means that that the genetic defect was inherited from one parent and is much more common. In certain populations such as French Canadians, the prevalence may be as high as 1 in 100. FH is a treatable disease. In addition to diet and lifestyle modification, medications are an essential tool in management. Some patients may require LDL apheresis, which is a method of removing the bad cholesterol from the blood. Some patients with the homozygote form have required liver transplantation to treat the disease.

Treatment of the underlying disease, of course, ultimately relieves the pleurisy. For example, if a heart, lung, or kidney condition is present, it is treated. Removal of fluid from the chest cavity (thoracentesis) can relieve the pain and shortness of breath. Sometimes fluid removal can make the pleurisy temporarily worse since now the two inflamed pleural surfaces can rub directly on each other with each breath. If the pleural fluid shows signs of infection, appropriate treatment involves antibiotics and drainage of the fluid. If there is pus inside the pleural space, a chest drainage tube should be inserted. This procedure involves placing a tube inside the chest under anesthesia. The tube is then connected to a sealed chamber that is connected to a suction device in order to create a negative pressure environment. In severe cases, in which there are large amounts of pus and scar tissue (adhesions), there is a need for \"decortication.\" This procedure involves examining the pleural space under general anesthesia with a special scope (thoracoscope). Through this pipelike instrument, the scar tissue, pus, and debris can be removed. Sometimes, an open surgical procedure (thoracotomy) is required for more complicated cases. In cases of pleural effusion that result from cancer, the fluid often reaccumulates. In this setting, a procedure called pleurodesis is used. This procedure entails instilling an irritant, such as bleomycin, tetracycline, or talc powder, inside the space between the pleural layers in order to create inflammation. This inflammation, in turn, will adhere or tack the two layers of pleura together as scarring develops. This procedure thereby obliterates the space between the pleura and prevents the reaccumulation of fluid.

The pain is in the chest and is usually sharp and aggravated by breathing. However, the pain can be confused with the pain of: inflammation around the heart (pericarditis) heart attack (myocardial infarction) To make the diagnosis of pleurisy, the doctor examines the chest in the area of pain and can often hear (with a stethoscope) the friction that is generated by the rubbing of the two inflamed layers of pleura with each breath. The noise generated by this sound is termed a pleural friction rub. (In contrast, the friction of the rubbing that is heard with pericarditis occurs synchronous with the heartbeat and does not vary with respiration.) With large amounts of pleural fluid accumulation, there can be decreased breath sounds (less audible respiratory sounds heard through a stethoscope) and the chest is dull sounding when the doctor drums on it (termed dullness upon percussion). A chest X-ray taken in the upright position and while lying on the side is an accurate tool in diagnosing small amounts of fluid in the pleural space. It is possible to estimate the amount of fluid collection by findings on the X-ray. Occasionally, as much as 4-5 liters of fluid can accumulate inside the pleural space. Ultrasound is also a very sensitive method of detecting the presence of pleural fluid. A CT scan can be very helpful in detecting trapped pockets of pleural fluid as well as in determining the nature of the tissues surrounding the area. Removal of pleural fluid with a needle and syringe (aspiration) is essential in diagnosing the cause of pleurisy. The fluid\\'s color, consistency, and clarity are analyzed in the laboratory. The fluid analysis is defined as either an \"exudate\" (high in protein, low in sugar, high in LDH enzyme, and high white cell count; characteristic of an inflammatory process) or a \"transudate\" (containing normal levels of these body chemicals). Causes of exudative fluid include infections (such as pneumonia), cancer, tuberculosis, and collagen diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus). Causes of transudative fluid are congestive heart failure and liver and kidney diseases. Pulmonary emboli can cause either transudates or exudates in the pleural space. The fluid can also be tested for the presence of infectious organisms and cancer cells. In some cases, a small piece of pleura may be removed for microscopic study (biopsied) if there is suspicion of tuberculosis (TB) or cancer.

Flying with a perforated eardrum Flying causes changes in air pressure, which can cause discomfort or pain in your ear, as well as temporary hearing loss. This happens particularly when the plane descends, because the pressure inside the aeroplane rises, meaning pressure in the middle ear is lower than that in the cabin. Air normally passes into or out of your middle ear through a tube connecting it to the back of your nose and throat (eustachian tube). The eustachian tube is closed most of the time and only opens when you yawn or swallow. This tube can become blocked when the pressure in an aeroplane rises. When you have a perforated eardrum, the air pressure in your middle ear can balance out more easily with the pressure in the surrounding air, because the air is able to pass through the hole. This means that flying with a perforated eardrum may cause less discomfort than flying with eardrums that arent perforated. To find out more about looking after your ears when you fly, see Action on Hearing Losss factsheet Flying and the ear (PDF, 257kb).

On the other hand, some people taking Xanax have reported weight loss. How can that be? Xanax is an anxiety-reducing medication (anxiolytic). For many people, eating behavior and ones relationship toward food is closely tied to their mood. Some people eat more and gain weight when theyre anxious. Other peoples nerves cause them to lose their appetite, eat less, and lose weight. No one knows exactly how Xanax changes appetite and eating behavior in people who take it. Likewise, no one can predict what an individual persons appetite response to Xanax will be. Xanax is habit-forming, and regular use can lead to physical dependency in a relatively short period of time.

It can be hard to separate out any side effects of the SSRI itself from the positive response to treatment. For example, some people with depression and\/or anxiety may regain their appetite as they start to feel better, eat more, and gain weight. Others may find the energy to exercise when they couldnt easily do so before, maintaining or losing weight. Each person responds to SSRI treatment slightly differently.

Thats what nearly all weight gain strategies come down to, although its not always quite that simple. People with certain health conditions are at risk for poor nutrition: Celiac disease Inflammatory bowel disease Cystic fibrosis Cancer Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection Many others. People who are losing weight with these conditions should ask their doctor for a referral to a nutritionist. A low appetite is often part of the illness, and eating higher-calorie foods is advised. Some of these illnesses can also cause poor absorption of nutrients, and testing and treatment can address this. In any medical condition, if muscle mass has been lost, its important to include protein in the diet to help rebuild muscles. Healthy young men and teenage boys often want to gain weight, usually in the form of muscle. Their challenge is usually eating enough to keep up with the calories theyre burning in their active lifestyles. To gain weight by building muscle, its necessary to eat a lot of protein. Weight-training athletes may require 75 to 100 grams of protein or more daily. Healthy lean protein sources include chicken, eggs, fish, and beans. Whey protein supplements can be mixed in with drinks, soups or sauces. Soy protein supplements are not advised except in small amounts, because some of the soy may be converted to estrogen in the body. Its best to talk to your doctor or a nutritionist before starting a high protein diet if you have any health conditions, especially liver or kidney disease.

An essential component of weight gain is eating enough calories each day. A registered dietitian will be able to calculate and estimate your calorie needs using the Harris-Benedict equation, or there are also websites available to help you do this on your own. In order to gain weight, theoretically you need to eat more calories than what would normally be necessary for you to maintain your current weight. Keep in mind, its still important to eat healthy and make the right food choices. Dont use this as an excuse to eat whatever you want, because youll end up gaining fat that way. Youll need to exercise too, especially by incorporating strength-building exercise, which will help to build muscle mass to add to your weight. The Surgeon General recommends at least two days per week of strength training, exercising each major muscle group. Of course, the more exercise that you do, the greater the benefits you should notice. Keep in mind, however, that you do need rest to allow your muscles to recover. Make sure that youre getting enough protein in your diet as well. Only protein has the essential amino acids necessary for muscle growth and development. A registered dietitian can also help you to determine your protein requirements. Ask your doctor before taking protein supplements or beginning a high protein diet.

Also, the clitorisa key center of sexual pleasure for most womenis likely to be less sensitive than in earlier years, possibly due to reduced estrogen levels and changes in the vascular and nervous systems. All of this may mean some reduction in the sensations and pleasure you experience during lovemaking. It also can affect orgasm, which may be less intense, take longer to achieve, or rarely happen at all. If you are troubled by a consistent difficulty or delay in reaching orgasm, or a consistent inability to reach orgasm after adequate stimulation, you may have what has been called \"female orgasmic disorder.\" In the final phase of lovemaking  after desire and sufficient arousal  a woman often achieves orgasm. But a persistent delay in, or complete absence of, orgasm that causes the woman marked distress has been labeled \"female orgasmic disorder\" (FOD).

Spinal stenosis is a fancy term that means \"narrowing of the spinal canal.\" The spinal canal is the hole in the middle of the vertebrae through which the spinal cord passes. Many things can cause narrowing of the spinal canal. Osteoarthritis is a key culprit. As you can imagine, anything that \"narrows\" the spinal canal puts pressure on the spinal nerves. This can result in irritation of the nerves. When nerves get irritated, they send out signals. These signals often are characterized as \"stinging,\" \"pinching\" or \"shock-like.\" Since the lumbar spine is the lower segment, where you back curves in, the nerves there supply the legs and other structures. If you\\'ve been diagnosed with lumbar spinal stenosis and you\\'re experiencing pinching and stinging sensations in the legs, that could be consistent with your diagnosis. Wishing you well!

When I first say it in 1988, or 1989, and by the way, it began in hair salons, that technology of morphing the before hair style into the proposed hair style, I said this is fantastic, and then they developed the software for medical practice. Basically you capture the image on a screen, and then you make the changes, and now the patient can see the before and the after. Its great, because it becomes a forum for discussion. Otherwise, its too abstract. If the doctor says, yes, I can narrow your nose, and I can take the bump off, but doesnt show you how much, you really arent going to have a clear idea of what youre signing up for. Personally, I dont think anybody should have these procedures without the imaging because its like buying a painting without seeing it. This is a little bit of an exercise by an artist when you consider what the doctor is doing. You need to see the end result, and will you be happy? For example, there are patients that come in, have a very bulbous tip of their nose, I show them what I believe is a doable, achievable, a credible result and they say, well can you make it even narrower. In their mind, they want something that I think isnt going to look right. Its going to look too narrow, too overdone, too pinched, so I will show them that, and say you know, do you really want this, and theyll say, yeah, you know, youre right, I dont. Lets go back to A wonderful place, a wonderful forum to exchange ideas. We need to have a common ground here. I need to know that when they look at that photo, theyd be happy, and I also need to be able to be comfortable that I can deliver it. Those are the variables, will the patient be happy with what I portray, and can I deliver it? Well, if the patient, after seeing even multiple options says yeah, Id be happy with that, and I think it looks good, in other words, in my mind, it looks right aesthetically, fits in, and then I say to myself, yeah, I can do that, I think were going to have a happy patient.

Mastery, meaning that doctor has pretty much mastered the subject, and ideally the subject that youre interested in. You cant master all 140 operations that one might be expected to do when you complete a residency. Its impossible. Its more complicated than ever, because there are more procedures, more products, more technology. So you want somebody who is working off a very small menu. I think ideally, you want a boutique practice, not a department store. Which means a doctor may limit himself to 5 or 6 procedures and thats it. The fewer the better, because hes going to be better at it, because hes doing it all the time. Repetition breeds excellence. Its like practice and basketball. The more you play, the better youre going to be. And those doctors also are so focused on what they do, they assemble a very highly specialized team. Thats very important. They have a very small core of helpers. They have their own surgical assistant. They work with just a handful of anesthesiologists, so everybody works like a well tuned machine. And thats exactly the way you want it, because it translates into safety and efficiency. And efficiency is important. Why have an operation that takes six hours and someone else can do it in three and get the same good result? And the operation that is done in three hours, I can guarantee you is done by somebody that does a lot of the operation, and the operation that takes 6 hours all other things equal is done by someone less specialized and therefore less skilled. And time is important. Its less time under anesthesia, as safe as anesthesia is, its better to be under less than more. Less bruising, less swelling, less trauma to the tissue, that translates into faster healing, back into the work force, back into social activities, so it all comes together. The master surgeons, the ones who have mastered the area in which they have chosen to work will have consistently the same qualities in their practice, staffing, focus, whatever research and writing they do for the medical journals will be in a limited array of subjects. I know some fantastic reconstruction surgeons, the kind of doctor Id want to go to if I were in a car accident that wouldnt be my first job to have a nose job or a face lift. Two different worlds.

Fees are negotiable. Now, not every practice buys into that, but I think that the practices that are very customer oriented, consumer oriented, they see value, and let me tell you what this fee negotiation is. Its not like begging for a lower fee. Theres a reason that would serve both the patient and the practice to have a lower fee. Example, the concept of stand-by airfare in the good old days of air travel, airlines would sell you a cheap seat, relatively cheap seat, and you came to the airline, and waited around, and oh yeah, we got an empty seat, somebody didnt show up, and bingo, theyll give you half off. Thats how we as students traveled a lot, student stand-by. It doesnt quite exist in the airline industry, theyve overcome that with their computers, they have no empty seats. But, if a patient says you know, can I save some money, then a reasonable answer from our practice would be well are you flexible on when you could come in and have your nose job or have your eyelids. In other words, you have the kind of job, you have the kind of life that allows that, because occasionally somebodys on the schedule and they call up a week before and they say you know what, I have a cold, or my kid is sick, or Ive got to go out of town, or my job says I cant take the time off. So now theres a vacancy created on a schedule thats been set for months ahead. So the surgery center has a seat open just like the airline has a seat open. The anesthesiologist, hes there, hes ready to work, the surgery center is ready to work, and weve committed that time. I havent scheduled a golf game that afternoon. So the answer is, you bet well give you a discount if you can slide in and take the space. Nothing wrong with it, its perfectly legitimate for the patient to have a monetary advantage for being flexible enough to give us efficiency of our operation. 50 I mean accounts and business people think thats just the best way to run it, and we agree, so thats one way. The other is, lets say you want to have something done, and your sisters got the nose that she doesnt like, and your cousin has one. If all three of the ladies come in together, consult together, and agree to have the procedures, they are eligible for what we call a family and friends discount because were going to be spending less time teaching on an individual basis. Because if were all sitting in a room and discussing the same procedures, its a lot more efficient for us. And so basically, we can pass that savings on, and the post operative care is easy, because frankly, one tells the other what its all about, and so, its about being more efficient in our practice, so people are entitled to have some benefit from that. You can also save money if you plan your operation far enough in advance and use the Christmas lay-away concept, where every month you send the practice a check, and by the 11th month youve already paid the practice so the normal 12th month payment would be free. I mean its just again what department stores have done so successfully, because there again, they are banking your money. But if youve got the money set aside, you can wind up paying less by essentially paying it far in advance of the time of surgery, because everybody does pay for the procedures you know, usually two weeks ahead of time, but you have to pay 6 months or a year ahead of time unless you are granted a courtesy discount. Now these are concepts that come from the business world, but its not unprofessional to do it. But its not the same as shopping for the lowest price by walking into a clinic and saying Dr. So and So will do my nose for $8,000, will you do it for $7,200? That, unless again, youre willing to go on the reserve list, in other words, it has to be a win-win. But service will be the same by the way. I mean people that have the benefit of a discount dont get a lesser result. Now when youre talking about the three women, youre not talking about putting them and doing all of their noses in the same operation? Same day, they could do it. As a matter of fact, if they do that, again, there will be an even greater savings, because that introduces tremendous efficiencies into the system. They could all recover at the same recovery facility, share a room. They save money there. So I mean, we know how to save people money without cutting quality. Its just you have to think like a consumer. The patient needs to think like a consumer. They are buying a service. Its a high quality service delivered by a conscientious professional but when it comes down to the dollars and cents of it, hey, as long as everybodys happy, nothings wrong with saving a few bucks and were glad to do it.

Room after room of people who, just a few hours previously, had their ribs split, their heart exposed to the circulating air of the operating room, and a human beings hands replacing a heart valve or sewing healthy grafts on diseased coronary arteries. And there they lay, with tubes, drips and ventilators monitoring their every movement and supporting every breath. Even the ones who are awake are groggy, and its not surprising when they fall asleep while Im talking or drift off in the middle of a sentence. This is heart surgery after all. Its the medical equivalent of being hit by a truck. Its a hard thing to grasp when you are signing a consent form, but sometimes being hit by a truck is worth it. Every day, thousands of peoples hearts see more blood flow and oxygen from new blood vessels, and valve replacement -- or repair -- fixes drafts and leaks and enables blood to travel where it needs to without being blocked by an obstruction. While we are able to do a lot of things these days without surgery, the OR still plays a very important role in extending life and improving its quality. One of the greatest concerns people have is post-operative recovery. While it is easier to quantify and estimate the risks related to surgery (or any invasive procedure for that matter), its the time afterward that can be more difficult to predict. For a day or two after surgery, most people experience significant fatigue, but typically, this period is self-limited and once the body really starts to heal, the progression is miraculous. Patients stroll around the wards, days after surgery, with chest tubes, catheters and invasive monitors just a memory from the intensive care unit. We typically discharge cardiac surgery patients on post-operative day five  its a testament to just how resilient the human body can be. But in all fairness, the real recovery then begins at home. We recommend that patients try to walk for twenty or thirty minutes each day, to help regain strength as well as improve lung function after surgery. Its not uncommon for people to feel fatigue for several weeks, or even a month or two after surgery. We arrange for a follow-up visit with our cardiologists as well as the heart surgeon to touch base a few weeks after surgery, examine the incision site to make sure that everything is healing well, and to adjust any medications if necessary. If you are going to have heart surgery, you definitely have questions  here are a few to help frame the discussion with your surgeon and cardiologist: * How many of these types of procedures have you done? * How would you estimate my risk of a complication as compared to other patients? * What type of valve replacement or repair do you recommend and why? * Where do you plan to obtain grafts (legs, arms, chest wall) for my bypass operation? * How soon can I travel after my surgery? * When do you anticipate that I can go back to work after surgery? * Do you recommend a cardiac rehabilitation program or physical therapy to help speed up my recovery? Its a long road, and not without its frustrations and challenges along the way. But it takes people where they want to be  and where they need to be in many cases. The surgeon and cardiologist are only part of the process  in my opinion the majority of the healing lies within the patients themselves.

The parent will be called, and the child excluded from school until they return with a doctors note. Granted, many types of pinkeye (conjunctivitis) are contagious. Combined with the hygiene practices of kids, pinkeye can quickly spread, especially in a preschool or day care. The eye is very sensitive and easily becomes pink when irritated. Allergies top the list for causing irritation and eye itching. You will see children constantly rubbing or knuckling their watery eyes, with dirty hands of course. Allergies are not contagious, but they can sure set the stage for a secondary bacterial infection. Highly chlorinated swimming pools cause pink or red eyes, too. This chemical conjunctivitis is not contagious, but a cautious teacher is not going to take the time to sort out the various types. They are going to exclude the child and have the medical provider properly diagnose them. I often see children excluded with a stye, or babies excluded from child-care facilities with a clogged tear duct (nasolacrimal duct obstruction). These are not contagious. Eyes get easily scratched during play. Sometimes, a baby with sharp, untrimmed fingernails will scratch his own corneas. A corneal abrasion is very painful, and the eyes will tear and become red or pink in response to this common injury. Among the most common causes of pinkeye are bacterial and viral infections. These infections can be contagious. Viral conjunctivitis does not usually require antibiotic treatment and typically resolves in two to four weeks. There may be a thin, watery discharge from the eye. Some types of viral conjunctivitis can be serious, such as that caused by the herpes simplex virus. Bacterial conjunctivitis is usually treated with antibiotic therapy. The discharge from the eye is thicker and can be profuse. Often people with bacterial conjunctivitis can return to work or school 24 hours after starting antibiotic therapy. Those with viral conjunctivitis may need to wait until their symptoms resolve. Be sure to check with your doctor in both cases.

Asperger syndrome is a form of autism, which is a lifelong disability that affects how a person makes sense of the world, processes information and relates to other people. Autism is often described as a \\'spectrum disorder\\' because the condition affects people in many different ways and to varying degrees. (For more information about autism, please read our leaflet What is autism? ) Asperger syndrome is mostly a \\'hidden disability\\'. This means that you can\\'t tell that someone has the condition from their outward appearance. People with the condition have difficulties in three main areas. They are: social communication social interaction social imagination. They are often referred to as \\'the triad of impairments\\' and are explained in more detail on page 3. While there are similarities with autism, people with Asperger syndrome have fewer problems with speaking and are often of average, or above average, intelligence. They do not usually have the accompanying learning disabilities associated with autism, but they may have specific learning difficulties. These may include dyslexia and dyspraxia or other conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and epilepsy. With the right support and encouragement, people with Asperger syndrome can lead full and independent lives. Is this what your looking for.

This article will cover the common ones. Studies show that losing up to 100-150 hairs per day is normal. Human hair naturally grows in three phases: anagen, catagen, and telogen. Anagen is the active or growing phase. Catagen is a fairly short phase of the natural hair cycle during which hairs begin to break down. Telogen is the resting phase. The hairs that are shed daily are often in the resting or late phase in the hair cycle. Normally, about 10% of the scalp hairs are in the resting or telogen phase at any time. These hairs are not growing and are getting prepared for cyclic shedding. In general, most hair loss is not associated with systemic or internal disease, nor is poor diet a frequent factor. Frequently, hair may simply thin as a result of predetermined genetic factors, family history, and the overall aging process. Many men and women may notice a mild and often normal physiologic thinning of hair starting in their thirties and forties. Other times, normal life variations including temporary severe stress, nutritional changes, and hormonal changes like those in pregnancy, puberty, and menopause may cause a reversible hair loss. Notably, several health conditions, including thyroid disease and iron deficiency anemia, can cause hair loss. While thyroid blood tests and other lab tests, including a complete blood count (CBC), on people who have ordinary hair loss are usually normal, it is important to exclude underlying causes in sudden or severe hair loss. If you are concerned about some other underlying health issues, you may start by seeing your family physician, internist, or gynecologist for basic health screening. Dermatologists are doctors who specialize in problems of skin, hair, and nails and may provide more advanced diagnosis and treatment of hair thinning and loss. Sometimes a scalp biopsy may be taken to help in diagnosis of severe or unexplained hair loss. Although many medications list \"hair loss\" among their potential side effects, drugs are also not overall common causes of thinning or lost hair. On the other hand, with cancer treatments and immune suppression medications including chemotherapy, hair loss is a very common side effect. Complete hair loss often occurs after a course of major chemotherapy for cancer. Usually, hair regrows after six to 12 months.

Although some women may notice hair thinning as early as their 20s, the pace of hair loss tends to be gradual, often taking years to become obvious to others. There seems to be a normal physiologic thinning that comes with age and occurs in many women in their early to mid 30s. More women have underlying causes of hair loss than men. These include treatable conditions like anemia and thyroid disease. In particular, women with a form of thyroid disease called Hashimoto\\'s autoimmune thyroiditis may have hair loss. These conditions are diagnosed by blood tests. Although a few studies have suggested that baldness may be inherited through the mother\\'s family genes, these theories require further testing. Current studies are inconclusive. While stories about hats choking off follicles or long hair pulling on the roots may be more folklore, repeat hair trauma like tightly woven hair pulled back and consistent friction can potentially worsen or cause localized hair loss in some individuals. Black individuals who pull their hair tightly back in a rubber band can develop a localized hair loss at the front of the scalp. Hair loss \"myths\" of special concern to women: Longer hair does not necessarily put a strain on roots. Shampooing does not accelerate hair loss; it just removes those that were ready to fall out anyway. Coloring, perming, and conditioning the hair do not usually cause hair loss.

The hair follicles will experience shorter growth phases and the hair they produce will become thinner and shorter. Aging is the most common cause of hair loss. In both male and female-pattern baldness (also called androgenetic alopecia) the growth period each hair follicle is shorter, and the resulting hair is not as thick nor as strong. Heredity will determine whether you will experience any degree of alopecia, and it will also determine the age at which you experience it. Certain disease states like ringworm can cause hair loss, as can medications, medical treatments, as well as poor nutrition. People who routinely follow severe fad diets often experience a significant degree of hair loss. Hormonal changes are also responsible for hair loss. During pregnancy women will have thicker, stronger hair, but after delivery will see a very significant loss of hair for about three months as their hormones restabilize.

Non-FDA-approved and off-label use of Propecia may be discussed with your doctor. Minoxidil (Rogaine) is available over the counter and available in 2%, 4%, and 5% concentrations. It may be something of a nuisance to apply twice daily, but it has been shown to help conserve hair and may even grow some. Minoxidil tends to grow very fine small hairs wherever it is applied. It is important to avoid running the liquid onto the face or neck where it can also grow hair. It is marketed for women at the 2% concentration but may be used in higher strengths as directed by your doctor. Propecia is a drug that is currently FDA approved only in men for help in hair loss. It has undergone extensive safety testing on women and it was found to be safe in postmenopausal women. It is unsafe for women of childbearing to take this drug or even handle tablets. (It is, however, safe for their husbands to take it while they are trying to become pregnant.) Propecia may be used as an off-label use in women who are not pregnant or planning to become pregnant while taking the medication. Studies have been inconclusive with effectiveness of Propecia in some women and not in others. Although it is not consistently effective, it may be a good option for postmenopausal women or women who are not pregnant or considering pregnancy.

There are thousands of unproven claims and products to help with hair regrowth. Many conditioners, shampoos, vitamins, and other products claim to help hair grow in some unspecified way. To slow down hair loss, there are at least four potentially effective, basic options. These include medications like Minoxidil, Propecia, and Avodart which are maintenance-type medications and are for long-term use. Stopping these drugs does not seem to worsen or exacerbate the prior hair loss. In other words, stopping the medication will not leave you worse than you started out prior to the medication. Minoxidil (Rogaine): This topical medication is available over the counter and no prescription is required. It can be used in men and women. It works best on the crown, less on the frontal region. Rogaine may grow a little hair, but it\\'s better at holding onto what\\'s still there. There are few side effects with Rogaine. The main problem with this treatment is the need to keep applying it once or twice a day, and most men get tired of it after a while. In addition, minoxidil tends to work less well on the front of the head, which is where baldness bothers most men. Inadvertent application to the face or neck skin can cause unwanted hair growth in those areas. Finasteride (Propecia): This medication is FDA approved for use in only men with androgenic hair loss. Finasteride is in a class of medications called 5-alpha reductase inhibitors. It is thought to help reduce hair loss by blocking the action of natural hormones in scalp hair follicles. Propecia is a lower-dose version of a commercially available drug called Proscar that helps shrink enlarged prostates in middle-aged and older men. Propecia 1 mg tablets are available by prescription and taken once daily. Propecia may grow and thicken hair to some extent for some people, but its main use is to keep (maintain) hair that\\'s still there. Studies have shown that this medication works well in some types of hair loss and must be used for about six to 12 months before full effects are determined. It may be best for men who still have enough hair to retain but also can help some regrow hair. Possible but very unlikely side effects include impotence or a decreased sex drive (libido). Studies have shown that these side effects were possibly slightly more common than seen in the general population and are reversible when the drug is stopped. Dutasteride (Avodart) has recently been used as \"off label\" to treat hair loss in men. It is FDA approved and primarily used to treat an enlarged prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH) only in men. Dutasteride is similar to finasteride (Propecia, Proscar) and is in a class of medications called 5-alpha reductase inhibitors. Dutasteride may help in hair loss by blocking the production or binding of a natural substance in the scalp hair follicles. There is a six-month clearance time required after taking this medication before being permitted to donate blood. A group of topical medications called prostaglandin analogs have recently began undergoing testing for potential hair regrowth. They may be used in men and women. These drugs are not currently FDA approved for scalp hair loss. Currently these are primarily used for eyelash enhancement. One of the new medications is called bimatoprost. Further testing and studies are required to assess the efficacy of these products in scalp hair loss. Bimatoprost solution (Latisse) has just been started to be used off-label for help in selected cases of hair loss. It is currently FDA approved for cosmetic eyelash enhancement. Studies have shown it can treat hypotrichosis (short or sparse) of the eyelashes by increasing their growth, including length, thickness, and darkness. This medication is also commercially available as Lumigan, which is used to treat glaucoma. It is not known exactly how this medication works in hair regrowth, but it is thought to lengthen the anagen phase (active phase) of hair growth.

But the upper end of that range may mean a greater chance of serious health problems. \"A number of studies have shown that, even within the normal range, a high resting heart rate is associated with an increased risk for ischemic heart disease, stroke, and sudden cardiac death,\" says Gordon F. Tomaselli, MD, professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore. Theres no absolute consensus about how high is too high, but most doctors agree that resting heart rates consistently in the upper range are not ideal. \"It is hard to set a precise cutoff for this risk factor, but usually a heart rate of 90 or above is considered abnormal and potentially deleterious,\" says Javaid Nauman, a research fellow at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim, Norway. To find your resting heart rate, press the index and middle fingers over the underside of the opposite wrist, just below the thumb. Press down gently until you feel your pulse. Count the beats for one minute, or count for 30 seconds and multiply by two. To ensure an accurate reading, sit quietly for at least 10 minutes before taking your pulse.

A stress test typically consists of a brisk walk on a treadmill according to a protocol of increasing speed and elevation. Electrocardiographic monitoring documents abnormal heart rhythms and other indicators that your heart is under stress from lack of oxygen during exercise. These more sophisticated measurements coupled with simpler signs like heart rate, blood pressure and exercise duration help your doctor better understand your level of fitness and your risk of having coronary artery disease. But the latest research suggests that we havent been doing it entirely the right way for about half of the population. You have probably heard that if you subtract your age from 220, you will get your predicted maximal heart rate. That is, if youre a man. The research studies that gave us this equation were performed on men, back in the 1970s. And like many studies performed on men (and like many things in the 1970s in general), the results dont always apply to women today. So a group of researchers at Northwestern University decided to tackle this question by monitoring exercise tests in over 5,000 women and looked for correlations between heart rate and increasing risk for heart attacks. Their data resulted in a new, improved and gender-appropriate calculation of 206 minus 0.88 of a womens age to predict maximal heart rate. The changes between the old and the new calculations might result in small differences in the peak heart rates doctors might expect you to achieve or the targets that might be used in exercise testing or even when youre at the gym. Its interesting information, but is it useful? For years, stress tests have been used to estimate cardiovascular risk with excellent track records in both women and men, despite using the same calculations. Occasionally, a stress test is considered suboptimal or less diagnostic if a person does not achieve a particular heart rate. Now that the threshold is different, this may result in more conclusive tests. But how should this impact your workout? While treadmills and elliptical machines present information about heart rate and zones for fat burning and cardiovascular training, the reality is that tailoring your workout to your heart rate is not as important as tailoring it to how you feel. You can have an excellent workout at a lower or higher heart rate depending on what you do and how long you are doing it. And tailoring your workout to your age (by using the heart rate calculation) just seems sort of depressing. The bottom line is that you should exercise consistently and to the best of your ability  regardless of your heart rate, age or sex. Competitive athletes and gadget hounds will find this new information helpful in gauging the intensity of a particular workout, but for the rest of us, the most important calculation is how to find time to get to the gym in the first place.

This is so true that some authors of Lyme disease research have stated that the most common cause of lack of response of Lyme disease to antibiotics is a lack of Lyme disease to begin with! The type of antibiotic depends on the stage of the disease (early or late) and what areas of the body are affected. Early illness is usually treated with medicines taken by mouth, for example, doxycycline (Vibramycin), amoxicillin (Amoxil), or cefuroxime axetil (Ceftin). Of note, doxycycline should not be used in pregnancy. Therefore, if a person finds a typical bull\\'s-eye skin rash (described above) developing in an area of a tick bite, they should seek medical attention as soon as possible. Generally, antibiotic treatment resolves the rash within one or two weeks with no long-term consequences. Later illness such as nervous-system disease might require intravenous drugs; examples are ceftriaxone (Rocephin) and penicillin G. For the relief of symptoms, pain-relieving medicines might be added. Swollen joints can be reduced by the doctor removing fluid from them (arthrocentesis). An arthrocentesis is a procedure whereby fluid is removed from a joint using a needle and syringe under sterile conditions. It is usually performed in a doctor\\'s office. Rarely, even with appropriate antibiotics, the arthritis continues. It has been suggested by researchers that sometimes joint inflammation can persist even after eradication of the Lyme bacteria. This has been explained as an ongoing autoimmune response causing inflammation of the joint that was initially stimulated by the original bacterial infection. The doctor also can use oral medications such as ibuprofen (Motrin, Nuprin) to reduce inflammation and improve function.

Thrush is caused by a fungus (more specifically, a yeast) called candida. Candida is a commensal organism, meaning that under healthy conditions it lives harmlessly in our bodies. We all have candida living on our skin and in our intestines, and healthy women carry candida in their vaginas. When the bodys defenses are in balance, candida is not noticeable or bothersome. However, certain conditions can give candida the opportunity to grow excessively: A low-functioning immune system. Use of topical or oral corticosteroids such as prednisone (often for asthma or autoimmune conditions). Damage to the mucous membranes (the skin lining the mouth, vagina, and GI tract). Antibiotic use. In these situations, candida can grow on the skin or in the lining of the mouth, GI tract, or vagina. The fungus creates a white patch or plaque across the mucous membranes. In the mouth, visible candida infection is called thrush. In the vagina, its a yeast infection. In people with weakened immune systems, candida can grow almost anywhere in the body. Because candida is normally present in all our bodies, someone with thrush cant exactly pass it to someone else -- that person already has candida.

One study has proved that in those who have schizophrenia a neurochemical imbalance is present. Researchers are studying the neurotransmitters and are testing drugs like antipsychotics on three of the neurotransmitters: dopamine, norepinefrine and serotonin. Scientists also discovered that people with schizophrenia have problems with the coordination between different areas of the brain. Normally when one area activates others decrease their activity but in schizophrenics these areas keep on being active in the same time with others. Also, during hallucinations of the patients researchers discovered some areas that manifested unusual activity. The research made in molecular biology showed that the schizophrenic patients had an irregular pattern of some brain cells. Scientists thought that this pattern might lead them to a possible cause of schizophrenia during the prenatal period or that it shows a possibility for a later development of this disease.

Depression  where you feel very low and lethargic. mania  where you feel very high and overactive (less severe mania is known as hypomania) Symptoms of bipolar disorder depend on which mood you are experiencing. Unlike simple mood swings, each extreme episode of bipolar disorder can last for several weeks (or even longer), and some people may not experience a \"normal\" mood very often. Schizophrenia is a long-term mental health condition that causes a range of different psychological symptoms, including: Hallucinations - hearing or seeing things that do not exist. Delusions - unusual beliefs not based on reality which often contradict the evidence. Muddled thoughts based on the hallucinations or delusions. Changes in behaviour. Doctors often describe schizophrenia as a psychotic illness. Do hope this is what you want.

This is a health professional trained to treat individuals with voice, speech, and language disorders. The speech-language pathologist will perform a comprehensive evaluation of the child\\'s ability to communicate and design an appropriate treatment program. In addition, the pathologist might make a referral for audiological testing to make sure the child\\'s hearing is normal. Teaching children with autism how to communicate is essential in helping them reach their full potential. There are many different approaches to improve communication skills in a child with autism. The best treatment program begins early, during the preschool years, and is tailored to the child\\'s age and interests. It also will address both the child\\'s behavior and communication skills and offer regular reinforcement of positive actions. Most children with autism respond well to highly structured, specialized programs. Parents or primary caregivers as well as other family members should be involved in the treatment program so it will become part of the child\\'s daily life. For some younger children, improving verbal communication is a realistic goal of treatment. Parents and caregivers can increase a child\\'s chance of reaching this goal by paying attention to his or her language development early on. Just as toddlers learn to crawl before they walk, children first develop pre-language skills before they begin to use words. These skills include using eye contact, gestures, body movements, and babbling and other vocalizations to help them communicate. Children who lack these skills may be evaluated and treated by a speech-language pathologist to prevent further developmental delays. For slightly older children with autism, basic communication training often emphasizes the functional use of language, such as learning to hold a conversation with another person, which includes staying on topic and taking turns speaking. Experts estimate that as many as 25 percent of all children with autism may never develop verbal language skills. For some of these children, the goal may be to acquire gestured communication, such as the use of sign language. For others, the goal may be to communicate by means of a symbol system in which pictures are used to convey thoughts. Symbol systems can range from picture boards or cards to sophisticated electronic devices that generate speech through the use of buttons that represent common items or actions.

Studies have shown some newer pacemaker models resist de-programming better than older models. Nonetheless, MRI generally should not be undertaken on a patient with a pacemaker unless there is a skilled staff member on hand who can re-program the pacemaker if it gets de-programmed during the test. MRI is a great test for some things, but it often can be replaced by a combination of various other imaging tests, such as CT scan plus X-ray. Bottom line?

When looking for a therapist, it is important to find one that is qualified, affordable, and that you can connect well with.

Ask about their credentials, making sure that they are a licensed psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker, or counselor. Offer a thumbnail sketch of your issue, and ask if this is the kind of issue that they treat and have expertise with. Ask what their approach is and why they think it would be helpful for you. As you listen to these answers, think about whether you feel comfortable not only with what they are saying but also with how they are saying it. In terms of finding someone you can afford, you might want to try a local clinic, hospital, or teaching institution (a school that trains therapists might have its own clinic) because they might have a sliding scale. Although those in training are less experienced (a downside) and might make you think twice about going, they also receive supervision-- and, sometimes the training is for experienced people working on a more advanced degree.

Symptoms of \t\t PVD include: Floaters in your field of vision . Floaters are thick \t\t\t strands or clumps of solid vitreous gel that develop as the gel ages and breaks \t\t\t down. Floaters often appear as dark specks, globs, strings, or dots. Floaters \t\t\t may also be caused by loose blood or pigment from retina tears. \t\t\t Flashes of light or sparks when you move your eyes or \t\t\t head. These are easier to see against a dark background. The brief flashes \t\t\t occur when the vitreous gel tugs on the retina (vitreous traction). These \t\t\t flashes usually appear at the edge of your visual field. Although an occasional floater is normal, floaters and \t\t flashes may be warning signs of retinal detachment. A sudden shower of what \t\t appear to be hundreds or thousands of little black dots across the field of \t\t vision is a distinctive sign of blood and\/or pigment in the vitreous gel and \t\t may indicate a retinal detachment. This requires immediate medical \t\t attention. Having floaters or flashes does not always mean that \t\t you are about to have a retinal detachment, but you should not ignore these \t\t symptoms. Call your doctor to discuss whether you need to have an eye exam . If \t\t you have a PVD, your doctor needs to examine your retina to determine your risk \t\t for a retinal tear or detachment, if one has not already occurred. If you have \t\t a retinal tear, early treatment may prevent a retinal detachment. Rarely, a retinal detachment can occur without warning. The first signs \t\t may be: A shadow or curtain effect across part of your \t\t\t visual field that does not go away. Because detachments usually affect \t\t\t peripheral (side) vision first, you may not notice a problem until the \t\t\t detachment has gotten bigger. New or sudden vision loss. Vision \t\t\t loss caused by retinal detachment tends to get worse over time. Sudden vision loss is a medical emergency. If you have new or sudden flashes or floaters, darkness \t\t over part of your visual field, or a new loss of vision that does not go away, \t\t call your eye doctor or regular doctor right away.

It is usually successful and, in \t\t many cases, restores good vision . The most common methods of \t\t repairing a retinal detachment are: Scleral buckling surgery . Your eye doctor ( ophthalmologist ) places a piece of silicone sponge, \t\t\t rubber, or semi-hard plastic on the outer layer of your eye and sews it in \t\t\t place. This relieves traction on the retina, preventing tears from getting \t\t\t worse, and it supports the layers of the retina. Pneumatic retinopexy . Your eye doctor injects a gas \t\t\t bubble into your eye. The bubble floats to the detached area and presses \t\t\t lightly against the tear, closing the tear and flattening the retina so that no \t\t\t fluid can build up under it. Your doctor then uses a freezing probe (cryopexy) or laser beam \t\t\t (photocoagulation) to seal the tear in the \t\t\t retina. Vitrectomy , or the removal of the \t\t\t vitreous gel from the eye. Vitrectomy gives the eye \t\t\t doctor better access to the retina to repair holes and close very large tears. \t\t\t The most common methods of repairing a retinal tear \t\t are: Laser photocoagulation . Your eye doctor uses an \t\t\t intense beam of light that travels through the eye to make tiny burns around \t\t\t the tear in the retina. The burns form scar tissue, which prevents fluid from \t\t\t entering the tear and collecting under the retina. Cryopexy (freezing). Your eye doctor uses a probe to \t\t\t freeze and seal the retina around the tear. Retinal tears that occur with symptoms (such as \t\t floaters or \t\t flashes of light ) are more likely to lead to a \t\t detachment. In these cases, repairing the tear can often prevent detachment. \t\t The decision to treat a tear depends on whether the tear is likely to progress \t\t to a detachment. For more information, see \t\t when to treat a retinal tear . If you \t\t have new or sudden flashes or floaters , darkness over part of your visual \t\t field, or a new loss of vision that does not go away, see a doctor or seek \t\t emergency care immediately. Sudden, rapid vision loss is a medical emergency. After surgery, you \t\t\t may need to use antibiotic eyedrops and \t\t\t corticosteroid medicines for a short time.

When this happens, your metabolism (the rate at which your body burns calories) can slow down because your body senses it is starving. Rapid or large amounts of weight loss can slow your metabolism by as much as 40% in six months. Losing muscle. When you lose weight, up to 25% can come from muscle tissue. And since muscle is the engine in your body that burns calories and helps maintain your metabolism, losing it can hinder weight loss. Weightlifting can help preserve and build muscle. Reaching your body\\'s particular set point -- the weight and metabolic rate your body is genetically programmed to be. Once you reach that point, it\\'s much harder to lose weight and even if you do, you\\'re likely to regain it. If you\\'re at a weight at which you\\'ve hit a plateau in the past, if your body generally seems to gravitate toward that weight, and you\\'re within a BMI (body-mass index) range of 20 to 25, then you may be at your set point. Decreasing your physical activity and\/or increasing your caloric intake. People lose weight all the time by reducing their caloric intake without doing any exercise, but it\\'s almost impossible to keep weight off without exercising. Many scientists agree that physical activity is the single best predictor of whether a person will maintain a weight loss. Other health factors, including thyroid or adrenal gland problems; medications like antidepressants; quitting smoking; menopause; and pregnancy. Even with any of the above factors, the bottom line to losing weight is eating fewer calories than you burn. Studies show that people almost always underestimate how many calories they\\'re eating. So if you\\'re struggling with weight loss, you\\'re still exercising, and you\\'ve ruled out any of the above reasons for weight plateaus, look at your calorie intake. As for exercise and weight plateaus, sometimes a change in routine can help. Instead of the treadmill, try the bike, or the stepper. Instead of a dance class, try a stretch and tone class. If you\\'re not weight lifting, this would be a good time to start. If you already do aerobic exercise, try adding intervals (short bursts of higher-intensity exercise) to your aerobic workouts. And keep reminding yourself that if you maintain an active lifestyle and continue with healthy eating, you will reach your goals.

This issue of size tugs at my doctors protective instincts (e.g. preventing disease and disability) while, as a woman, I feel deeply for any woman who has ever sobbed while staring at her closet trying to find something decent to wear. This issue of what constitutes a healthy size and weight is a hot topic of debate among scientists and experts in the field. Dr. Steven Blair has championed the notion that its all about fitness, not size, while others argue the smaller, the better to ensure optimal health and longevity. Since no one has a solution, let me boldly go forward with a few suggestions: 1. Your size issue must involve health and wellness. Looking at physical appearance alone without considering overall health and fitness is leaving off half of your best body equation. If youre really interested in living life to the fullest, that requires you do the work to stay fit, and nourish yourself healthfully. You want to clothe a healthy, happy woman  not just a size. 2. Know thyself. Just like you know your size, you need to know your other body numbers. Take a tape measure to your waist. If its greater than 35?, youre packing on inner abdominal pounds placing you at higher risk of developing heart disease and diabetes. If your body fat is greater than 35%, youre at higher risk for breast cancer and potentially ovarian cancer. Too much weight can also have an accumulative effect on your weight bearing joints, eventually leading to arthritis and disability. Many of my patients are very fit, a size 10-14, normal waist size, and a good body fat percentage. Keep in mind, the goal is not to be skinny. Its to be healthy, physically independent and out of the red zone for disease and disability. 3. All women need to pay attention to their self-care. To stay out of the red zone, youve got to take care of yourself. Your mind and body benefit from daily physical activity (ideally accruing about 400 cals throughout the day, and injecting intervals of intensity), as well as healthy nutrition (high quality whole foods, being mindful of portions and total calories consumed, and eating a balanced meal\/snack every 3-4 hour through dinner). Science backs me up on this recommendation, which is true for men and women alike. 4. Women need attractive, enjoyable clothing options to live and exercise in. When a woman is beginning her journey toward improving her lifestyle habits, she wants to feel good about herself. Better larger size (16 and over) clothing options help her accomplish that goal. Many of my patients often call these clothes transitional. As a woman gets more active and pares away more excess body fat, shell transition to other clothing, which may end up being size 12-14. 5. Remember that the goal is optimal health and fitness. There are plenty of skinnies out there that are woefully unfit and unhealthy. This is not about weight. Its about the quality of your body, as well as your mind. Is your body fit enough to allow you to do the things you love in life? Are you in pain due to a sedentary lifestyle? Get real and be honest. If youre walking around carrying 200 pounds or more, you know that the excess weight will eventually cause problems. Take a moment and examine your lifestyle. Pinpoint easy things you can begin to do today to make it healthier. Health, not skinny, is the goal.

Dont be discouraged; a few simple changes may be all that you need. For exercise, consider the F.I.T.T. principle: F  Frequency  How often or how many days you exercise I  Intensity  How hard you work during your exercise T  Time  How long or how many minutes you spend per session. T  Type  The type of activity that you are doing Making adjustments in one of these areas could help you break through your plateau. Of course, the more that you do with your exercise, the greater the benefits you should see from it. For example, lets say that your current exercise routine is walking three times per week for thirty minutes at a moderate intensity. You could add more days per week or spend more time per session to expend more calories and hopefully further boost your metabolism to promote weight loss. Try increasing the intensity by walking at a quicker pace or incorporating intermittent bouts of jogging. You could also try carrying arm weights, having a weighted backpack, or incorporating more hills or inclines to challenge yourself further. Your body may have just become accustomed to your exercise routine, so sometimes it can also be helpful to change the type of activity as well. Try different forms of cardiovascular exercise or try doing strength-building exercise if youre not already. With nutrition, try reassessing your dietary intake. In what ways can you eat healthier? Can you eat out less often or drink less soda? What about having less chips, pastries, or candy? Can you increase your fruit or vegetable intake? Try food journaling to track and monitor your dietary intake so that you can better recognize areas for improvement. Dont forget to reevaluate your calorie needs as you continue to lose weight.

Eighty percent of people with osteoporosis are women. Twenty percent are men. Family history. If one of your parents had osteoporosis or broke a bone as an adult, you are more likely to get osteoporosis. Being small and thin. People who are thin or have small bones are more likely to get osteoporosis. Low estrogen levels. Estrogen levels drop when a woman goes through menopause or has her ovaries removed. Teen girls and young women who often miss their periods usually have low estrogen levels. Low testosterone levels. Low levels of testosterone in men can lead to osteoporosis. Not getting enough calcium and vitamin D. Getting enough calcium helps build strong bones when you are younger and helps keeps them strong later in life. Your body needs vitamin D to absorb calcium. Lack of exercise . Your bones get strong when you make them work. Two types of exercises that help keep your bones healthy are weight-bearing and muscle-strengthening exercises. Medicines.

Heart failure can be caused by weakness of the heart muscle, which pumps blood out through the arteries to the entire body, or by dysfunction of the heart valves, which regulate the flow of blood between the chambers of the heart. The diminished volume of blood pumped out by the heart (decreased cardiac output) is responsible for a decreased flow of blood to the kidneys. As a result, the kidneys sense that there is a reduction of the blood volume in the body. To counter the seeming loss of fluid, the kidneys retain salt and water. In this instance, the kidneys are fooled into thinking that the body needs to retain more fluid volume when, in fact, the body already is holding too much fluid. This fluid increase ultimately results in the buildup of fluid within the lungs, which causes shortness of breath. Because of the decreased volume of blood pumped out by the heart (decreased cardiac output), the volume of blood in the arteries is also decreased, despite the actual increase in the body\\'s total fluid volume. An associated increase in the amount of fluid in the blood vessels of the lungs causes shortness of breath because the excess fluid from the lungs\\' blood vessels leaks into the airspaces (alveoli) and interstitium in the lungs. This accumulation of fluid in the lung is called pulmonary edema. At the same time, accumulation of fluid in the legs causes pitting edema. This edema occurs because the build-up of blood in the veins of the legs causes leakage of fluid from the legs\\' capillaries (tiny blood vessels) into the interstitial spaces. An understanding of how the heart and lungs interact will help you to better comprehend how fluid retention works in heart failure. The heart has four chambers; an auricle and a ventricle on the left side of the heart and an auricle and ventricle on the right. The left auricle receives oxygenated blood from the lungs and transfers it to the left ventricle, which then pumps it through the arteries to the entire body. The blood then is transported back to the heart by veins into the right auricle and transferred to the right ventricle, which then pumps it to the lungs for re-oxygenation. Left-sided heart failure, which is due primarily to a weak left ventricle, usually is caused by coronary artery disease, hypertension, or disease of the heart valves. Typically, when these patients initially come to the doctor they are troubled by shortness of breath with exertion and when lying down at night (orthopnea). These symptoms are due to pulmonary edema that is caused by pooling of the blood in the vessels of the lungs. In contrast, right-sided heart failure, which often is due to chronic lung diseases such as emphysema, initially causes salt retention and edema. Persistent salt retention in these patients, however, may lead to an expanded blood volume in the blood vessels, thereby causing fluid accumulation in the lungs (pulmonary congestion) and shortness of breath. In patients with heart failure due to weak heart muscle (cardiomyopathy), both the right and left ventricles of the heart are usually affected. These patients, therefore, can initially suffer from swelling both in the lungs (pulmonary edema) and in the legs and feet (peripheral edema). The physician examining a patient who has congestive heart failure with fluid retention looks for certain signs. These include: pitting edema of the legs and feet, rales in the lungs (moist crackle sounds from the excess fluid that can be heard with a stethoscope), a gallop rhythm (three heart sounds instead of the normal two due to muscle weakness), and distended neck veins. The distended neck veins reflect the accumulation of blood in the veins that are returning blood to the heart.

The idea behind the fat-burning option is this: Because fat is denser than carbohydrate, it requires more oxygen to burn. So, to maximize the percentage of fat you burn, compared to carbohydrate, the fat-burning mode would have you work out at a pace at which your body can deliver lots of oxygen to your muscles. That generally means a slow pace, to keep you from getting breathless. The problem is that when you exercise at a slower speed, you burn fewer total calories -- from both carbohydrate and fat -- because you simply don\\'t do as much work. Further, the way to get aerobically fit is to get your heart rate into the training range (usually 60% to 85% of your maximum heart rate), which is hard to do at slower speeds. And fitness is ultimately what you\\'re after, whether your goals are better health, burning calories, or improving heart and lung capacity.

The key concepts to understand here are the percentage of calories that come from fat and total calories. The fat burning mode is typically set at lower exercise intensity where more calories burned come from fat. Not as many calories burned during higher exercise intensity will come from fat. The point to understand though is that while more of the calories that you burn will come from fat at a lower exercise intensity, you have the potential to burn more calories per session doing higher exercise intensity. The percentage of calories burned from fat will be lower during the higher exercise intensity, but you will be burning more calories overall, including the amount of calories from fat. Also, higher exercise intensity leads to a greater boost in metabolism even after youre done exercising, which burns additional calories. Its best to do exercise that youre comfortable with and that meets your level of training\/conditioning.

A blood pressure reading appears as two numbers. The first and higher of the two is a measure of systolic pressure, or the pressure in the arteries when the heart beats and fills them with blood. The second number measures diastolic pressure, or the pressure in the arteries when the heart rests between beats. Optimal blood pressure is less than 120\/80 (systolic\/diastolic). In healthy people, low blood pressure without any symptoms is not usually a concern and does not need to be treated. But low blood pressure can be a sign of an underlying problem -- especially in the elderly -- where it may cause inadequate blood flow to the heart, brain, and other vital organs. Chronic low blood pressure with no symptoms is almost never serious. But health problems can occur when blood pressure drops suddenly and the brain is deprived of an adequate blood supply. This can lead to dizziness or lightheadedness. Sudden drops in blood pressure most commonly occur in someone who\\'s rising from a prone or sitting position to standing. This kind of low blood pressure is known as postural hypotension or orthostatic hypotension. Another type of low blood pressure can occur when someone stands for a long period of time, This is called neurally mediated hypotension. Postural hypotension is considered a failure of the cardiovascular system or nervous system to react appropriately to sudden changes. Normally, when you stand up, some blood pools in your lower extremities. Uncorrected, this would cause your blood pressure to fall. But your body normally compensates by sending messages to your heart to beat faster and to your blood vessels to constrict. This offsets the drop in blood pressure. If this does not happen, or happens too slowly, postural hypotension results. The risk of both low and high blood pressure normally increases with age due in part to normal changes during aging. In addition, blood flow to the heart muscle and the brain declines with age, often as a result of plaque buildup in blood vessels. An estimated 10% to 20% of people over age 65 have postural hypotension.

For example, if insufficient blood flows to the brain, brain cells do not receive enough oxygen and nutrients, and a person can feel lightheaded, dizzy, or even faint. Going from a sitting or lying position to a standing position often brings out symptoms of low blood pressure. This occurs because standing causes blood to \"settle\" in the veins of the lower body, and this can lower the blood pressure. If the blood pressure is already low, standing can make the low pressure worse, to the point of causing symptoms. The development of lightheadedness, dizziness, or fainting upon standing caused by low blood pressure is called orthostatic hypotension. Normal individuals are able to compensate rapidly for the low pressure created by standing with the responses discussed previously and do not develop orthostatic hypotension. When there is insufficient blood pressure to deliver blood to the coronary arteries (the arteries that supply blood to the heart\\'s muscle), a person may develop chest pain (a symptom of angina) or even a heart attack. When insufficient blood is delivered to the kidneys, the kidneys fail to eliminate wastes from the body, for example, urea (BUN) and creatinine, and increases in their levels in the blood occur. Shock is a life-threatening condition where persistently low blood pressure causes organs such as kidney(s), liver, heart, lung, and brain to fail rapidly.

Flashbacks etc. happen because the trauma never leaves our active memory (i.e. it\\'s idling in the background of your thoughts continually with the threat radar activated). I think talk therapy is very necessary because it helps me let the pressure out of my head and helps me realize what triggers set off my PTSD. However, talk therapy or CBT can only take you so far. EMDR will be needed to help decrease and eventually stop the flashbacks and anxiety attacks. Another therapy that may help are medications classified as Beta-Blockers. They are thought to decrease the amount of adrenalin released and therefore decrease the fight\/flight response. There is also the PTSD forum - ptsdforum.org.

According to the National Sleep Foundation, over 60% of Americans admit to driving while feeling drowsy. Even more shocking is that at least 37% of respondents said they had actually fallen asleep while driving. People with sleep apnea are twice as likely to be involved in collisions caused by sleep deprivation. The number of accidents caused by sleepy drivers may be about to decline. Testing is already under way in Europe for something known as a road train, a train of cars that are wirelessly controlled by a lead vehicle. Drivers of the individual cars are then free to take their eyes off the road and do many things a driver cannot usually do, like read, eat, work  even sleep. This mode of transportation could be available as soon as 2021, and would certainly cut down on the number of collisions caused by human error, especially drowsy driving. The individual cars would have to be specially engineered for advanced steering and wireless control of acceleration and speed; you could not use your current car in the occasional road train on particularly difficult Mondays. Still, the idea is not only pretty cool but also pretty safe: the name for the European commission overseeing the project is SARTRE, which stands for the European Commission-backed Safe Road Trains for the Environment. It is also exceptionally fuel-efficient. Its practically human nature to underestimate the negative effects associated with fatigue and sleep deprivation and, conversely, overestimate our abilities to overcome them while driving. The National Sleep Foundation reports that very few parents speak to their children about the dangers of driving while drowsy; teen drivers are just as, if not more likely, than adults to drive while sleepy.

When the different organs use oxygen from the blood to perform their functions, they release the used blood containing waste products (such as carbon dioxide) into the veins. Blood in the veins is then transported to the heart and returned to the lungs, where the waste carbon dioxide is released and more oxygen is loaded by the blood and taken back to the rest of the body by the arteries. Veins also act as a storage for unused blood. When the body is at rest, only a portion of the available blood in the body circulates. The rest of the blood remains inactive in the veins and enters the active circulation when the body becomes more active and needs the additional blood to carry oxygen to the entire body. This storing capacity is due to the elasticity (flexibility to expand) of the walls of the veins. Veins have different sizes depending on their location and function. The largest veins are in the center of the body; these collect the blood from all the other smaller veins and channel it into the heart. The branches of these large veins get smaller and smaller as they move away from the center of the body. The veins closer to the skin surface are called superficial veins. The veins that are deeper and closer to the center of the body are called deep veins. There are also other veins that connect the superficial veins to the deep ones which are called the perforating veins.

They may include racing or pounding heartbeat (palpitations) chest pains stomach upset dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea difficulty breathing, a sense of feeling smothered tingling or numbness in the hands hot flashes or chills trembling and shaking dreamlike sensations or perceptual distortions terror, a sense that something unimaginably horrible is about to occur and one is powerless to prevent it a need to escape nervousness about the possibility of losing control and doing something embarrassing fear of dying Although the duration of a panic attack can vary greatly, it typically lasts for more than 10 minutes, is one of the most distressing conditions that a person can experience, and its symptoms can closely mimic those of a heart attack. Typically, most people who have one attack will have others, and when someone has repeated attacks with no other apparent physical or emotional cause, or feels severe anxiety about having another attack, he or she is said to have panic disorder. A number of other emotional problems can have panic attacks as a symptom. Some of these illnesses include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), schizophrenia, and intoxication or withdrawal from certain drugs of abuse. Certain medical conditions, like thyroid abnormalities and anemia, as well as certain medications, can produce intense anxiety. Examples of such medications include stimulants like methylphenidate (Ritalin), diabetes medications like metformin and insulin, antimalarial medications like quinine, as well as corticosteroid withdrawal, such as withdrawal from dexamethasone (Decadron). As individuals with panic disorder seem to be at higher risk of having a heart valve abnormality called mitral valve prolapse (MVP), this possibility should be investigated by a doctor since MVP may dictate the need for special precautions to be taken when the individual is being treated for any dental problem. While the development of panic attacks have been attributed to the use of food additives like aspartame, alone or in combination with food dyes, more research is needed to better understand the role such substances may have on this disorder. Anxiety attacks that take place while sleeping, also called nocturnal panic attacks, occur less often than panic attacks during the daytime but affect about 40%-70% of those who suffer from daytime panic attacks. This symptom is also important because people who suffer from panic symptoms while sleeping tend to have more respiratory distress associated with their panic. They also tend to experience more symptoms of depression and other psychiatric disorders compared to people who do not have panic attacks at night. Nocturnal panic attacks tend to cause sufferers to wake suddenly from sleep in a state of sudden fear or dread for no apparent reason. In contrast to people with sleep apnea and other sleep disorders, sufferers of nocturnal panic can have all the other symptoms of a panic attack. The duration of nocturnal panic attacks tends to be less than 10 minutes, but it can take much longer to fully calm down for those who experience them. While panic disorder in adolescents tends to have similar symptoms as in adults, symptoms of panic disorder in younger children are less likely to include the thought-based or so-called cognitive aspects. Specifically, teenagers are more likely to feel unreal or as if they are functioning in a dream-like state (derealization) or be frightened of going crazy or of dying. Symptoms of panic attacks in women tend to include more avoidance of anxiety provoking situations, show more frequent recurrence, and more often result in the use of medical care compared to panic attack symptoms in men. The frequency of panic attacks may increase, decrease, or remain unchanged during pregnancy.

The abrupt surge can occur from a calm state or an anxious state: 1. Palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate 2. Sweating 3. Trembling or shaking 4.

Such symptoms should not count as one of the four required symptoms. To be diagnosed with Panic Disorder, a person must have: A. Recurrent unexpected panic attacks B. At least one of the attacks has been followed by 1 month (or more) of one or both of the following: 1. Persistent concern or worry about additional panic attacks or their consequences (e.g., losing control, having a heart attack, going crazy). 2.

It is not an herb, a vitamin, or a mineral. Hormones are naturally produced by your body as you need them. Which means it is very unlikely that someone has a melatonin deficiency. While melatonin could be considered natural, in most cases it doesnt come from the earth. There are exceptions of foods that contain melatonin in them, but this is a different type of melatonin than what is produced in your brain. Your melatonin levels can be tested with a blood test, urine test or saliva test. If you are concerned that you may actually be melatonin deficient, ask your doctor about testing. Melatonin is produced by the pineal gland and sends a signal to regulate the sleep-wake cycle in the sleep center of the brain. This is the really important thing you should understand about melatonin: Melatonin is a sleep and body-clock regulator not a sleep initiator. Melatonin works with your biological clock by telling your brain when it is time to sleep. Melatonin does not increase your sleep drive or need for sleep. Melatonin is called the Vampire Hormone because it is produced primarily in darkness and inhibited by light. The levels of your melatonin increase in the middle of the night and gradually fall as the night turns to morning, so exposure to light before bed can push your biological clock in the wrong direction  making melatonin ineffective. Melatonin treats circadian rhythm disorders (where you sleep the right amount of minutes but your body clock is at the wrong time), shift work sleep disorders and early morning awakenings  all things that deal with the timing of your need to sleep. Melatonin is not considered an effective treatment for insomnia. Melatonin in pill form does not function like your bodys naturally produced melatonin: it affects the brain in bursts and rapidly leaves the system, instead of the slow build up and slow wash-out that your bodys naturally produced melatonin experiences. The correct dosage of melatonin can be a problem. According to research conducted at MIT, the correct dosage of melatonin for it to be effective is 0.3-1.0 mg. Many commercially available forms of melatonin are in 3 to 10 times the amount your body would need. In fact, there is some evidence that higher doses may be less effective. In Europe, melatonin at very high doses has been used as a contraceptive. Melatonin can have side effects. Melatonin (2-3 mg or higher) has reported side effects of: Headaches. Nausea. Next-day grogginess. Hormone fluctuations. Vivid dreams and nightmares. Melatonin may also have some issues with safety. In the US, melatonin is sold as a dietary supplement, not a medication, so until recently melatonin has not been subject to the same purity rules and standards as prescription medications. So what does all this mean if you want to try melatonin as a supplement? Melatonin has been shown to be safe in healthy people when used for up to three months at the correct dosage. Over-the-counter (OTC) melatonin: When taken several hours before sleep, melatonin can shift the biological clock earlier, making a better environment for falling asleep and waking up on time. When taken in the correct dose (0.3-1 mg), it can be effective for shift workers and people with circadian rhythm disorders. However, most melatonin sold over the counter is packaged in doses ranging from 1 mg to 10 mg, with most doses containing double or triple the amount that is needed to be effective for the population that will benefit from its use. Caution should be taken when using melatonin: It should be used under the guidance of a doctor and sleep professional. It should be used at the correct dosage. It should be taken about 90 minutes before lights out. It should be used for a short time (less than three months). It should never be used in combination with other sleep-inducing medications. It should never be used with alcohol. It should never be used with children (younger than 18 years). There are possible interaction effects and could change the effectiveness of your current medication regimen.

I know of more than one M.D. who uses their judgemrnt (like Michael Breus does) by suggesting and perscribing melotonin. This demonstates the truth that the majority of people are unaware of. Doctors simply use their best judgement and therefore can have different opinions depending on their experiance and knowledge. My personal experiance did have limited success with melotonin and groginess the following day when using 3 mg (I may have also taken it too late at night). Some other insomiac nights, a tried 1 mg. or less, combined with chamomile tea and that worked much better. Now I don\\'t take melotonin at all and in retrospect beleive that, for me at least, the chamomile tea is what really relaxed me and gave me sound sleep. Now if I drink coffee too late in the day, I understand that I created my oun insomnia. Still if I need to go to sleep, rather than using melotonin, I use the two herbs; chamomile and valarian. also potatoes seems to make me sleepy (very strange). In any event I like the one answer of the person who found that \"GABA\" calmed her anxiety and \"worked like a charm\". I also found that GABA is an inhibitor of anxious thougts and insomnia. I now take it weather or not I can sleep well. It just seems to make my moods more even. One more thing when I get more activity or exersize earlier in the day, or when I\\'m working in the day (paid or not), my \"nervous energy\" is spent up, my body makes it\\'s OWN melotonin (via: serotonin created through exersize) and I sleep soundly. Maybe that\\'s what a writer of Provbers meant once when he observed, \"The sleep of a laboring man is sweet, weather he eats little or much; but the restlessness of the rich man (because they do no psysical labor) will not allow him to sleep\". No wonder in his day Solomin was called the wisest man. He was rich too, but not before he was wise. And that\\'s the key, wisdom. Because if we don\\'t know what we\\'re doing, we cannot get the desired result. One more thing, if I exersize or work hard during the day, but I drink much coffee after 12:00 noon, then I STILL can\\'t sleep. It\\'s only natural. And it isn\\'t nice to fool with mother nature. So let\\'s be nice to ourselves and our true nature. Our body is wiser than our minds and it is best to understand and \"listen to it\" so we don\\'t get fooled again. P.S. \"If at first you don\\'t succeed, try another way\". and my favorite poam of hope and peace, \"For every ailment under the sun, the is an answer - or there is none.

The standard guidelines state clinicians should work closely with patients to do what it takes to keep the A1c at 7.0 or less. It is not good practice to let the A1c stay above 7.0 for very long. In fact, if a patient has already tried to implement lifestyle changes and is already on metformin, the next step is to offer another oral drug or offer going directly to insulin without adding a second oral medication. An alternative approach, which I certainly favor, is to work with the patient to take the lifestyle changes to a greater level. To accomplish this, most patients need some sort of a \"wake up call\" which helps them see the urgency and potential payoff of making such changes on a long-term basis. Your doctor is trying to get you to make lifestyle changes so that you can get your A1c to 7.0 or less, otherwise you risk the fate of the vast majority of patiients with type 2 diabetes, specifically escalating doses of medication and\/or increasing risk of complications such as blindness, limb loss, kidney failure and chronic dialysis, and premature heart disease or stroke. Your doctor is \"threatening\" you with insulin shots in order to jolt you into making lifestyle changes! He or she believes this is for your own good. The good news is that a weight loss of about 5-10% or 10-20 pounds is typically enough to get the A1c down from 8 to 7 in my experience. To do so, I work with my own patients toward following an ambitious eating plan at the 90% strictness level, and aiming for 7 hours per week of exercise. Even if one can only be 80% strict and get 4 hours of exercise it typically makes a substantial difference. ...

Before the new \"insulin pens\" came out, there were four : rapid-acting, short-acting, intermediate-acting, and long-acting. When it comes to the pre-mixed insulins, like Novolog 70\/30, there are fewer differences between the brands (for example, Novolog versus Novolin). Whether contained in a bottle or in a pen, the premixed insulins all contain a combination of both an intermediate-acting insulin and a short-acting insulin. The numbers on the bottle or pen refer to the percentage of each type of insulin contained in the mixture. That means both Novolin 70\/30 and Novolog 70\/30 contain a mixture that is 70% intermediate-acting insulin with 30% short-acting insulin. However, Novolin 70\/30 takes slightly longer to begin working than Novolog 70\/30, which has a rapid onset. Both Novolin 70\/30 and Novolog 70\/30 may last up to 24 hours in the system. No matter what kind of insulin you\\'ve been prescribed, it\\'s crucial you understand how to use it correctly. Using any insulin incorrectly can cause serious side effects.

Psoriasis typically occurs on the knees, elbows, and scalp and can also affect the torso, palms, and soles of the feet. The symptoms of psoriasis vary depending on the type you have. Some common symptoms for plaque psoriasis -- the most common variety of the condition -- include: Plaques of red skin, often covered with loose, silver-colored scales. These lesions may be itchy and painful and sometimes crack and bleed. In severe cases, the plaques of irritated skin will grow and merge into one another, covering large areas. Disorders of the fingernails and toenails, including discoloration and pitting of the nails. The nails may also begin to crumble or detach from the nail bed. Plaques of scales or crust on the scalp. Psoriasis can also be associated with psoriatic arthritis, which leads to pain and swelling in the joints. The National Psoriasis Foundation estimates that between 10% to 30% of people with psoriasis also have psoriatic arthritis. There are many forms of psoriasis, each differing in location, severity, and duration. The most common is called plaque psoriasis. Red, scaly, cracked skin on the palms of the hands and\/or feet with tiny pustules is called pustular psoriasis.

Being swaddled makes them feel secure and can calm them. Babies also tend to like loud, repetitive sounds like radio static or the sound of washing machines, so if you go shhhh-shhhh in your babys ear that can work, as well. But you do have to do the \"shhhing\" loud enough to be heard over the babys crying. The reason they like sounds like this is that they remind the baby of the sound of their mothers heartbeat. Another thing I like to try is singing; some babies really respond well to their parents voice. You can also try turning babies on their the sides when youre holding them, and giving them something to suck on, like a pacifier or your finger. Or try taking the baby out in a stroller.

Although sleep disorders can significantly affect your health, safety, and well-being, they can be treated. Talk to your doctor if you have any of these signs of a sleep disorder: You consistently take more than 30 minutes each night to fall asleep.

You often feel sleepy during the day, you take frequent naps, or you fall asleep at inappropriate times during the day. Your bed partner says that when you sleep, you snore loudly, snort, gasp, make choking sounds, or stop breathing for short periods. You have creeping, tingling, or crawling feelings in your legs or arms that are relieved by moving or massaging them, especially in the evening and when trying to fall alseep. Your bed partner notices that your legs or arms jerk often during sleep. You have vivid, dreamlike experiences while falling asleep or dozing.

It appears that the immune system is the most important factor in determining whether a person can rid herself of this virus rather than develop a persistent infection. The immune system is relatively immature early in life. Therefore, the younger a person is when HBV is contracted, the greater the likelihood that the infected person will become a chronic carrier of the disease. If an adult is infected, her probability of developing chronic disease is very lowapproximately 1 to 5 percent. If a person contracts the infection in infancy, there is as much as a 90- to 95-percent chance that her immune system will be unable to eliminate this virus from her body. Children fall somewhere in between, having approximately a 25 to 35 percent chance of going on to chronic disease. Men are six times more likely than women to become chronic carriers of HBV. The reason for this has not been determined. Also, people with poor immune systemssuch as those infected with HIV, organ recipients, and those undergoing chemotherapyhave a much lower success rate of eliminating the virus from their bodies. Patients who are the sickest during their acute illness, especially those who develop jaundice or who survive fulminant hepatitis, have the highest likelihood of totally recovering, and thus not progressing to a chronic disease.

Arthritis . Arthritic conditions such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis are among the most common causes of hip pain, especially in older adults. Arthritis leads to inflammation of the hip joint and the breakdown of the cartilage that normally cushions your hip bones. The pain gradually gets worse as the arthritis progresses. People with arthritis also feel stiffness and have reduced range of motion in the hip. Hip fractures . Fractures of the hip are a particular problem in elderly people. With age, the bones can become weak and brittle. Weakened bones are more likely to fracture during a fall. Bursitis . Inflammation of the small, fluid-filled sacs (called bursae) that protect muscles and tendons is usually due to repetitive activities that overwork or irritate the hip joint. Tendinitis . Tendons are the thick bands of tissue that attach bones to muscles. Tendinitis is inflammation or irritation of the tendons. It\\'s usually caused by repetitive stress from overuse. Muscle or tendon strain . Repeated activities can put strain on the muscles, tendons, and ligaments that support the hips. When these structures become inflamed from overuse, they can cause pain and prevent the hip from functioning normally. Cancers . Tumors that start in the bone (bone cancer) or that spread to the bone can cause pain in the hips, as well as in other bones of the body. Avascular necrosis (also called osteonecrosis) . This condition occurs when blood flow to the hip bone is reduced and the bone tissue dies as a result. Although it can affect other bones, avascular necrosis most often occurs in the hip. It can be caused by a hip fracture or dislocation, or from the long-term use of high-dose steroids (such as prednisone), among other causes.

Medical History and Physical Exam To diagnose pulmonary embolism, the doctor will ask about your medical history and perform a physical exam to: Identify your risk factors for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism See how likely it is that you could have pulmonary embolism Rule out other possible causes for your symptoms During the physical exam, the doctor will check your legs for signs of DVT. He or she also will check your blood pressure and your heart and lungs. Diagnostic Tests There are many different tests that help the doctor determine whether you have pulmonary embolism. The doctor\\'s decision about which tests to use and in which order depends on how you feel when you get to the hospital, your risk factors for pulmonary embolism, available testing options, and other conditions you may have. You may have one of the following imaging tests: Ultrasound. Doctors use this test to look for blood clots in your legs. Ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to check the flow of blood in your veins. A gel is put on the skin of your leg. A hand-held device called a transducer is placed on the leg and moved back and forth over the affected area. The transducer gives off ultrasound waves and detects their echoes after they bounce off the vein walls and blood cells. A computer then turns the echoes of the ultrasound waves into a picture on a computer screen, where your doctor can see the blood flow in your leg. If blood clots are found in the deep veins of your legs, you will begin treatment. DVT and pulmonary embolism are both treated with the same medicines. Spiral CT scan or CT angiogram. Doctors use this test to look for blood clots in your lungs and in your legs. Dye is injected into a vein in your arm to make the blood vessels in your lungs and legs more visible on the X-ray image. While you lie on a table, an X-ray tube rotates around you, taking pictures from different angles. This test allows doctors to detect pulmonary embolism in most patients. The test only takes a few minutes. Results are available shortly after the scan is completed. Ventilation-perfusion lung scan (VQ scan). Doctors use this test to detect pulmonary embolism. The VQ scan uses a radioactive material to show how well oxygen and blood are flowing to all areas of the lungs. Pulmonary angiography is another test used to diagnose pulmonary embolism. It\\'s not available at all hospitals, and a trained specialist must perform the test. A flexible tube called a catheter is threaded through the groin (upper thigh) or arm to the blood vessels in the lungs. Dye is injected into the blood vessels through the catheter. X-ray pictures are taken to show the blood flow through the blood vessels in the lungs. If a clot is discovered, the doctor may use the catheter to extract it or deliver medicine to dissolve it. Certain blood tests may help the doctor find out whether you\\'re likely to have pulmonary embolism. A D-dimer test measures a substance in the blood that\\'s released when a clot breaks up. High levels of the substance mean there may be a clot. If your test is normal and you have few risk factors, pulmonary embolism isn\\'t likely. Other blood tests check for inherited disorders that cause clots and measure the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide in your blood (arterial blood gas). A clot in a blood vessel in your lung may lower the level of oxygen in your blood. To rule out other possible causes of your symptoms, the doctor may use one or more of the following tests. Echocardiogram uses sound waves to check heart function and to detect blood clots inside the heart. EKG (electrocardiogram) measures the rate and regularity of your heartbeat. Chest x ray provides a picture of the lungs, heart, large arteries, ribs, and diaphragm. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses radio waves and magnetic fields to make pictures of organs and structures inside the body. In many cases, an MRI can provide information that can\\'t be seen on an X-ray.

It\\'s important to keep in mind that the symptoms may be caused by other things besides being pregnant. So the fact that you notice some of these symptoms does not necessarily mean you are pregnant. The only way to tell for sure is with a pregnancy test. Spotting and cramping. Breast changes. Fatigue. Nausea (morning sickness). Missed period. The altered balance of hormones in your body can cause multiple symptoms. Many women find frequent urination to be problem starting around the sixth or eighth week after conception. Although this could be caused by a urinary tract infection, diabetes, or excessive use of diuretics, if you\\'re pregnant, it\\'s most likely due to increased levels of hormones. The increased level of progesterone can also make you constipated. Progesterone causes food to pass more slowly through your intestines. Drinking plenty of water, exercising, and eating plenty of high-fiber foods can help offset this problem. Mood swings are common, especially during the first trimester. These are also related to changes in hormones. Many women report frequent mild headaches, and others experience chronic back pain. Dizziness and fainting may be related to dilating blood vessels, lower blood pressure, and lower blood sugar. Some women don\\'t discover they\\'re pregnant until they go to the doctor because of a fainting spell and are told that being pregnant is a possible explanation.

Suddenly we\\'re much more aware of our cycles and our bodies. We chart our ovulation carefully, we time our BD, and then we wait  which is the hardest part. We watch for any symptoms that might indicate pregnancy, and with every pang or every woozy feeling we think, \"Is that a symptom??\" To talk a little about the science of symptoms Most current pregnancy tests are based on the presence of a chemical called human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG). Although this chemical is present very early, the pregnancy has to connect with your blood system before it can be detected and before you would expect your body to have any symptoms of pregnancy. This connection is made with implantation, which occurs 8-10 days after conception. So symptoms (and a positive pregnancy test) might occur a few days before you actually miss your period. Breast changes: There can be a dramatic increase in breast volume early in pregnancy resulting in breast tenderness, tingling or noticeable increase in size. This symptom can happen days before you miss your period. Nausea and vomiting: This symptom tends to happen a little later than the breast changes but definitely in the first trimester. It generally happens around the time of your missed period or slightly later (4-6 weeks pregnant) and resolves around 14-16 weeks of your pregnancy. It has been called morning sickness but actually is present throughout the day. Fatigue: It can be dramatic through the first trimester but doesn\\'t usually show up before you\\'ve missed your period. Pelvic cramping: Many women complain of cramping in early pregnancy. They usually describe it as feeling \"like my period is about to start.\" It can last for weeks but usually remains more of a background nuisance discomfort than real pain. Although it is a very common normal symptom, you should discuss any pelvic pain in early pregnancy with your physician because it can sometimes be a warning sign of a dangerous medical condition. Bleeding: This is a scary one! Many normal pregnancies can have light bleeding with implantation. But when you tell us about bleeding, we\\'re worried about the same thing you\\'re worried about, could this be a miscarriage. Fortunately we can usually sort things out fairly quickly and put everyone\\'s mind at ease. Although it\\'s a very common, \"normal\" symptom, it\\'s another symptom that is sometimes a warning sign of a dangerous medical condition so be sure to tell your physician about any unexpected bleeding. Of all of the symptoms listed above, breast changes are really the only symptoms that usually occur before you\\'ve missed a period. But, of course, as human beings, we have not only the \"science\" of symptoms to consider, but the emotional component as well  after all, deciding to get pregnant is an emotional decision. So, the tricky part for most women is that we can sometimes experience some of these symptoms  or think we are experiencing the symptoms  but we\\'re NOT pregnant at all. Quite an emotional rollercoaster to ride month after month! **To re-emphasize: the symptoms listed above can be symptoms of pregnancy, but they can also be symptoms of other medical conditions  please see your doctor if you experience these symptoms.** ","votes":"921","membertype":"Expert","helpful":"823","title":"What are some pregnancy symptoms?","url":"http:\/\/answers.webmd.com\/answers\/1190687\/what-are-some-pregnancy-symptoms","membername":"\"Yvette Smith","membervotes":"0"},{"descr":"","questionId":"1193840","followers":"0","ans":"Not all women get early symptoms.

Three of the most common types of depressive disorders are discussed below. However, remember that within each of these types, there are variations in the number, timing, severity, and persistence of symptoms. Major depression Major depression is characterized by a combination of symptoms that last for at least two weeks in a row, including sad and\/or irritable mood (see symptom list below), that interfere with the ability to work, sleep, eat, and enjoy once-pleasurable activities. Disabling episodes of depression can occur once, twice, or several times in a lifetime. Dysthymia Dysthymia is a less severe but usually more long-lasting type of depression compared to major depression. It involves longterm (chronic) symptoms that do not disable but yet prevent the affected person from functioning at \"full steam\" or from feeling good. Bipolar disorder (manic depression) Another type of depression is bipolar disorder, which encompasses a group of mood disorders that were formerly called manic-depressive illness or manic depression. These conditions show a particular pattern of inheritance. Not as common as the other types of depressive disorders, bipolar disorders involve cycles of mood that include at least one episode of mania and may include episodes of depression as well. Bipolar disorders are often chronic and recurring. Sometimes, the mood switches are dramatic and rapid. But most often, they are gradual. When in the depressed cycle, the person can experience any or all of the symptoms of a depressive disorder. When in the manic cycle, any or all of the symptoms listed later in this article under mania may be experienced. Mania often affects thinking, judgment, and social behavior in ways that cause serious problems and embarrassment. For example, indiscriminant or otherwise unsafe sexual practices or unwise business or financial decisions may be made when a person is in a manic phase. A significant variant of the bipolar disorders is designated as bipolar II disorder. Bipolar II disorder is a syndrome in which the affected person has repeated depressive episodes punctuated by what is called hypomania (mini-highs). These euphoric states in bipolar II do not fully meet the criteria for the complete manic episodes that occur in bipolar I. Symptoms of major depression or manic depression Persistently sad, anxious, angry, irritable, or \"empty\" mood Feelings of hopelessness, pessimism Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, helplessness Loss of interest or pleasure inactivities that were once enjoyed, including sex Insomnia, early morning awakening, or oversleeping Decreased appetite and\/or weight loss, or overeating and\/or weight gain Fatigue, decreased energy, being \"slowed down\" Crying spells Thoughts of death or suicide, suicide attempts Restlessness, irritability Difficulty concentrating, remembering, making decisions Persistent physical symptoms that do not respond to treatment, such as headaches, digestive disorders, and\/or chronic pain Children and adolescents with depression may also experience the classic symptoms described above but may exhibit other symptoms instead of or in addition to those symptoms, including the following: Poor school performance Persistent boredom Frequent complaints of physical problems such as headaches and stomachaches Change in eating or sleeping patterns. Teen depression may be characterized by the adolescent taking more risks, showing less concern for their own safety. Mania symptoms of manic depression Inappropriate elation Inappropriate irritability or anger Severe insomnia or decreased need to sleep Grandiose notions, like having special powers or importance Increased talking speed and\/or volume Disconnected or racing thoughts Severely increased sexual desire and\/or activity Markedly increased energy Poor judgment Inappropriate social behavior ","votes":"367","membertype":"Expert","helpful":"343","title":"What are the types of depression and their symptoms?","url":"http:\/\/answers.webmd.com\/answers\/1172863\/what-are-the-types-of-depression","membername":"\"Carolyn O'Neil","membervotes":"0"},{"descr":"","questionId":"1172863","followers":"0","ans":" atypical depressionis not unusual.

It can be found in spinach, lentils, liver, asparagus, beans, and collard greens. Some research studies have shown that folate tablets can help treat depression, but these are small and poorly regulated studies. 2) Your liver takes the folate you eat in your diet and converts it to a special form of brain folate called L-methylfolate (LMF). However, your liver has the ability to only convert a little bit of regular folate into brain LMF at a time. Therefore you can eat all the spinach in the world but still only get little bits of LMF into your brain at a time. 3) Once in the brain, LMF has the theoretical ability to provide nerves with the ability to make more neurotransmitters such as serotonin. This boost in serotonin allows antidepressants that work by manipulating serotonin to have a greater chance to work their antidepressant mechanisms. LMF tablets are available by prescription now as they are considered a medical food, similar to prenatal vitamin classifications. 4) More stringent research studies that compare LMF to placebo sugar pills are being published and scrutinized, and it appears that adding LMF products to antidepressants may improve depression symptoms. These studies are preliminary in nature but are clearly better regulated and supportive in that LMF may be safe and help in the treatment of depression. Larger, 400 patient studies are needed to prove definitive antidepressant effects, but these current medium sized studies are promising.

Gynecologists are the appropriate doctors to treat genital herpes for a woman. For both sexes STD (sexually transmitted disease) clinics are appropriate. For a man, a urologist, a dermatologist, or an infectious disease doctor would be the appropriate choice to help you with your treatment plan. Although there is no cure for herpes, treatments can relieve the symptoms. Medication can decrease the pain related to an outbreak and can shorten healing time. They can also decrease the total number of outbreaks. Drugs including Famvir, Zovirax, and Valtrex are among the drugs used to treat the symptoms of herpes. Warm baths may relieve the pain associated with genital sores. Preventing the spread of genital herpes is extremely important. If you have genital herpes, you can still spread the disease if you have no symptoms. Although daily antiviral medication reduces the risk of spreading genital herpes, it doesnt totally eliminate the risk. A herpes vaccine is in the works, but unfortunately has not been perfected at this time. That is why practicing safe sex and using a condom are the keys to preventing the spread of genital herpes.

This time its all about cocoa. So, whats all the commotion about? First, lets look at cocoa for a moment. Both chocolate and cocoa powders originate from the cocoa bean. The beans are picked and fermented to destroy the germ. Next up, theyre dried, roasted and ground to remove the nibs where the cocoa butter is found. This results in a thick paste known as chocolate liquor which is further refined by drying and grinding. And, voila, you now have cocoa powder. Dutch Cocoa is cocoa that has been treated with an alkali to create a darker, richer, product. Many of the organic cocoas will note that their product is not made with alkaline processing. Since the cocoa butter has been extracted, cocoa is low-fat. Here are the typical cocoa ingredients: 1 Tbsp. = 20 calories, 0.5g fat, 0g sat fat, 0g mono fat, 1g protein, 3g carbohydrates, 0mg sodium, 0mg cholesterol. Cardiologists and researchers at the University of California at San Francisco just published a study in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology in which they found that cocoa plant nutrients called flavanols decrease blood pressure, improve the integrity of blood vessels and increase the number of circulating blood-vessel-forming cells two-fold in people with heart disease. Foods rich in flavanols are cardio-protective and include cocoa, green tea, wine, as well as assorted fruits (apples, cherries, grapes) and vegetables. Now, weve known for a while that flavanols convey heart-healthy benefits. We just didnt know how. These researchers have discovered a valuable piece to this puzzle. It appears that flavanols increase the circulation of angiogenic cells, which play a critical role in the repair of blood vessel walls, where plaque often builds up and damages the delicate vessel lining. This damage is a hallmark of early heart disease. Therefore, anything that can protect the lining will help save lives. Scientists selected 16 coronary artery disease patients, average age 64 years, who received a high-flavanol cocoa drink (containing 375 mg of flavanols) twice a day over 30 days and then a nutrient-matched low-flavanol cocoa drink (containing 9mg flavanols) twice a day over 30 days. The study was planned such that both the doctors and patients were prevented from knowing which cocoa drink a patient was drinking at a given time until after the study was completed. The patients continued taking all regular medications for their underlying heart disease during the study period, including statin medications which are typically used for lowering the cholesterol levels. The tests showed a 47 percent improvement in widening of the brachial artery in the high-flavanol time period compared to the low-flavanol period. In addition, circulating angiogenic cells increased 2.2-fold and blood pressure decreased among the high-flavanol versus low-flavanol periods. So, how about bumping up the flavanoids in your diet today? Cocoa is a great first step. Just remember that these phytonutrients provide antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits to protect us from not only heart disease, but cancer as well. And here are some flavanoid-rich foods and herbs you may want to include in your healthy nutrition as well: * Lettuce (whole plant). * Basil (leaf). * Cranberry (fruit). * Garlic (bulb). * Cabbage (leaf). * Kale (leaf). * Brussels sprouts (axillary bud). * Spinach (leaf). * Asparagus (root). * Soy (seed). * Lima bean (leaf). * Kidney bean (fruit). * Garden pea (shoot). * Dill (seed). * Tea (whole plant). * Thyme (whole plant). * Peppermint (whole plant). * Chamomile (whole plant). * Beetroot juice. * Olive oil. * Jasmine.

Home treatment can relieve symptoms and slow down the progress of \t\t varicose veins . For many people with varicose veins, home treatment is the only \t\t treatment they need. If you have varicose veins, you can help \t\t control the problem and keep it from getting worse if you: Wear compression stockings . Compression \t\t\t stockings improve circulation and are the mainstay of treatment for varicose \t\t\t veins. Elevate your legs . Prop up your legs at or above the \t\t\t level of your heart when possible. Avoid long periods of sitting and standing . Standing or sitting for long periods puts added \t\t\t stress on the veins in your legs. Exercise and control your weight . Walk, bicycle, or swim to improve blood circulation in your \t\t\t legs. Superficial varicose veins can sometimes cause minor \t\t problems like bruising or bleeding if you scratch or cut the skin over a larger \t\t vein. Small blood clots may occasionally form in the surface veins (superficial \t\t phlebitis). Most of these problems can be safely treated at home. If you bump your leg so hard that you know it \t\t\t is likely to bruise, elevate your leg and apply ice or a cold pack as soon as \t\t\t you can for the next hour or two. This may help reduce the amount of bleeding \t\t\t under the skin and minimize bruising. If you cut or scratch the \t\t\t skin over a vein, it may bleed a lot. Elevate your leg and apply firm pressure \t\t\t with a clean bandage over the site of the bleeding. Continue to apply pressure \t\t\t for a full 15 minutes. Do not check to see if the bleeding has stopped sooner. \t\t\t If the bleeding hasn\\'t stopped after 15 minutes, apply pressure again for \t\t\t another 15 minutes. You can repeat this up to three times for a total of 45 \t\t\t minutes. Signs of a small blood clot in a superficial varicose vein \t\t (superficial phlebitis) include tenderness and swelling over the vein. The vein \t\t may feel firm.

Interesting statistics show that over the age of 50, one of two people is affected by veins. Apparently there is even a hereditary factor. Most varicose veins occur, of course, on the legs and represent our anatomys constant battle with gravity. The traditional means of dealing with varicose veins in the legs has always depended on the size of the veins. For larger veins, there was always the classic ligation and stripping, which involves several incisions made along the course of the veins and literally pulling the veins out from their beds. But, that often left quite a bit of swelling and bruising and took a lot of time to heal, and was not really a fabulous procedure. Now, the so called endovascular procedures are performed, whereby, thin tubes or catheters are placed within the hollow of the veins, and either using radio frequency or laser treatments, the veins literally become shriveled up. The only way of dealing with smaller varicose veins is to inject them with a solution that, again, causes such irritation that the veins tend to collapse on themselves and are no longer prominent. That is known as sclerotherapy. Typically, the medications involved in sclerotherapy are very irritating. Even normal saline solution (sterile salt water) can be used. For many years, there were just a few medications available. Apparently, a drug from Europe, known as polidocanol, marketed in the United States as Asclera, is recommended for the tiniest veins that are known as spider veins. Spider veins are known as that because there is usually a feeder central vein from which smaller veins radiate. As the article pointed out, when surgery is indicated, it is an outpatient procedure done under local anesthesia and, perhaps, a bit of sedation. Remember that it is important to wear compression stockings after these treatments to help reduce the bruising and swelling, and hasten healing and resolution.

So a lot of people come in and tell me they have varicose veins, but they have the little spider veins. So for the larger veins that are true varicose veins, the big blue ones that can kind of course down the legs, that tend to be more genetic, those ones are sometimes treated with lasers. But those lasers are more within the vein. And are done either by a certain type of dermatologist who specializes in that or a vascular surgeon. The lasers that we use on the surface of a skin really treat them more superficial, very small types of pinkish or bluish veins, not the larger ones. I find that if I can get a needle into a vessel sclerotherapy, which is injecting a sclerosing, something that will irritate that vessel lining will help eliminate that vein much better than a laser would. But once we have only the little remnants, those tiny little vessels left behind, then lasers work very well. I also only use lasers on the ankles.

It includes the simplest of ingredients and preparation, but is so satisfying. If you have access to white cannellini beans (canned or in a jar) at your store, that is my favorite type of white bean to use. If not, you can use a white navy bean. Beans are one of the few items out of a can that I fully encourage to use. Most of us dont have time to make beans from their dried form. Having extra cans in the pantry allows for a weeknight dinner in less than 20 minutes of cook time and about five minutes of prep time. First you will want to get beef, lamb, or pork and cut into two-inch chunks. (You can buy stew meat or a more tender piece of meat like the loin). If you use a stew meat, note that the meat will have a chewier texture than if you were to make a dish that you slow cook for hours. For me, I dont mind this texture for the time I save. You will need a pot that can hold two cans of beans and about one pound of meat. First, salt and pepper your meat. Heat a bit of extra virgin olive oil in the pan and brown your meat. At this point, you can add fresh chopped garlic (about a tablespoon) and sage (about a tablespoon). You can substitute rosemary or thyme or do a combination of the three. Add firmer vegetables like potatoes and carrots after the meat. From there, you will add your rinsed beans, and a 1\/2 cup of broth or water. You can get creative with what type of veggie you want to add. I like to take a head of dinosaur kale and cut it into one-inch strips or a few cups of baby spinach and add this at the end. Small cut-up carrots and or celery works, as well. Cook everything together for 15-20 minutes over medium heat. If you are using kale or spinach, add it in about five minutes before you are done with cooking time. You are then ready for a quick, healthy and delicious comfort meal.

Does he or she have trouble focusing and completing a task? You may be wondering if your child has Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). For starters, a diagnosis of ADHD is based on a combination of inattentive, impulsive and hyperactive behaviors that are inappropriate for the age of the child. And most of the time, ADHD is not diagnosed until a child enters school. Why? Because virtually all preschoolers have trouble paying attention and sitting still! So, dont book a consultation with your childs doctor because your preschooler doesnt want to sit around during storytime. Heres what you need to know about ADHD: Q. Is ADHD hereditary? Yes. Interestingly, ADD [attention deficit disorder] and ADHD tends to run in families. Often, a parent realizes he or she has the disorder when his or her child is going through the evaluation process. Q. What signs should I be looking for in my child? * Hyperactivity: A child will constantly fidget with his hands or body. He may seem like he is always on the go. He may have trouble sitting in his seat or playing quietly. And, he may talk incessantly. * Impulsivity: A child will have trouble taking turns in play. He may blurt out answers in the classroom or interrupt other childrens activities. As a result, he may be rejected by his peers. * Inattention: A child may be very disorganized and have trouble completing tasks, even ones that are fun. He may be forgetful and gloss over details. Q. What is the difference between ADD and ADHD? The H stands for hyperactivity. Kids with ADD are not fidgety or loud and so they have fewer behavior problems in the classroom. Thus, they often are diagnosed later  often a child will be eight or nine before ADD kids are identified. Q. If I am worried about ADD\/ADHD, who should I turn to for help? Start with your childs teacher. He or she can fill out a checklist that demonstrates your childs successes and challenges in a classroom setting. You will also be asked to do an assessment of your child in your home setting, as well. The next step is to discuss the finding with your childs doctor. The doctor may conduct the complete evaluation and treatment process himself, or he may refer your child for additional evaluations and potentially, treatment with a specialist.

In addition, they may experience excessive daytime sleepiness. AD\/HD has been generally demonstrated to reduce the time in rapid eye movement (REM) or \"dream\" sleep among children, while also increasing the frequency of periodic leg movements. There are several theories about the causes of sleep disturbances in people with AD\/HD. One simple explanation is that the sleep disturbances are direct manifestations of the problems with arousal associated with the AD\/HD itself. In addition to insomnia, many adults and children with AD\/HD report being restless when they sleep, but for some it may be more serious than just tossing and turning. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) and sleep-disordered breathing or obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are among the more commonly observed sleep disorders in people with AD\/HD. It seems that people with restless legs syndrome (RSL) are more likely to have attention deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (AD\/HD) than people without RLS. In a recent review of clinical studies reporting cases of RLS and AD\/HD, Cortese and colleagues (2005) found that 44% of the subjects with AD\/HD in these studies were found to have RLS, and as many as 26% of subjects with RLS also had AD\/HD. In another preliminary study (Zak, et al, 2009) found 20% of adults with AD\/HD had RSL compared to 7.2% of the controls. For years, the association of sleep disorders and AD\/HD has been overlooked because of the focus on insomnia as a side effect of stimulants medication used to treat AD\/HD, rather than a coexisting condition. Stimulants may be associated with a delay of sleep onset and insomnia, in some people, but in a significant number of patients with AD\/HD, stimulants may actually improve sleep initiation.

In diabetic people, arthropathy usually affects the foot and ankle. (Arthritis may also be present.) Hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy: The ends of bones in the ankles, knees, wrists, and elbows start to grow abnormally and painfully in an adult. The tips of the fingers become rounded, called clubbing. This form of arthropathy occurs more often in people with lung cancer. Hemarthrosis: Bleeding into a joint like the knee can occur after injuries or medical procedures and is a common problem in people with hemophilia.

The spine is made up of 24 vertebrae (not including the sacrum and coccyx). Each vertebra is smooth and rounded on the \"front facing\" side and has bony protrusions on the \"back facing\" side. When you run your hand down someone\\'s back, you feel those protrusions. Each vertebra has a large hole in the center, through which the spinal cord passes. Each vertebra also has smaller holes (called foramina) through the sides, which allow the roots of larger nerves to branch off from the spinal cord and extend into the rest of the body. \"Foraminal stenosis\" refers to a narrowing of these smaller holes or channels in the sides of the vertebrae. Often, foraminal stenosis is caused by arthritis or bone spurs that basically clog up the channels and put pressure on the nerve roots. Remember those bony protrusions I referred to earlier? Those things help link the vertebrae together. Each of them has two joints called \"facets\" that allow you to bend forward and backward. \"Facet arthropathy\" refers to an arthritis of these facet joints. \"Bilateral\" simply means arthritis affects the facet joints on both sides of each vertebra.

The adolescent period (ages 12 to 20) are the most psychological and physiological developmental period in which critical changes occur. In teens who consume alcohol these important changes can be hindered. The ability to identify the signs of alcohol abuse and alcoholism in your teen may save his or her life. Parents can help their teens best by being able to recognize the signs of teen alcohol abuse. A dramatic decline in grades, change in behavior and attitude, lost interest in activities that they were once committed to, withdrawing from their usual crowd and spending time with a new crowd; are all indicative that your adolescent could be struggling with alcohol abuse. There are some informative resources available online that can help parents glean insight into teens and alcohol including the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism which not only offers tips on how to talk to your teen about alcohol use, but also help parents be prepared to help their teen.

The craving that an alcoholic feels for alcohol can be as strong as the need for food or water. An alcoholic will continue to drink despite serious family, health, or legal problems. Like many other diseases, alcoholism is chronic, meaning that it lasts a person\\'s lifetime; it usually follows a predictable course; and it has symptoms. The risk for developing alcoholism is influenced both by a person\\'s genes and by his or her lifestyle. Is alcoholism inherited? Research shows that the risk for developing alcoholism does indeed run in families. The genes a person inherits partially explain this pattern, but lifestyle is also a factor. Currently, researchers are working to discover the actual genes that put people at risk for alcoholism. Your friends, the amount of stress in your life, and how readily available alcohol is also are factors that may increase your risk for alcoholism. But remember: Risk is not destiny. Just because alcoholism tends to run in families doesn\\'t mean that a child of an alcoholic parent will automatically become an alcoholic too. Some people develop alcoholism even though no one in their family has a drinking problem. By the same token, not all children of alcoholic families get into trouble with alcohol. Knowing you are at risk is important, though, because then you can take steps to protect yourself from developing problems with alcohol. Can alcoholism be cured? No, alcoholism cannot be cured at this time. Even if an alcoholic hasn\\'t been drinking for a long time, he or she can still suffer a relapse. Not drinking is the safest course for most people with alcoholism. Can alcoholism be treated? Yes, alcoholism can be treated.

TSH tells the thyroid how much thyroid hormone should be produced. TSH is the best test to evaluate the overall functioning of the thyroid. So if the TSH value is below normal, that means the thyroid is producing too much thyroid hormone and if the TSH level is above normal, there is not enough T4, T3, and free T4.

Further testing might be used to isolate an underlying cause. These tests might include more blood testing for thyroid antibodies, nuclear medicine thyroid scanning, ultrasound of the thyroid gland, or others. If thyroid cancer is suspected and surgery may be required, a physician may ask for a blood test known as thyroglobulin. Thyroglobulin is a protein made only by thyroid cells. If the thyroglobulin level at baseline is detectable or elevated (this means the gland does in fact make the protein) it can be used as a tumor marker. After a total thyroidectomy for cancer (removal of the entire thyroid gland) the level should fall to an undetectable range since the cells that make thyroglobulin have been removed. If the level remains detectable after surgery, there is a possibility of thyroid tissue elsewhere in the body, which means the cancer may have spread. If the level is undetectable for a period of time after surgery and then starts to climb, a recurrence of the cancer -- either at the primary site or elsewhere in the body -- should be considered.

For example, if you have myasthenia gravis, you may notice that during a meal, your jaw muscles become tired and weak, interfering with your ability to chew food. After you have rested for a little while, the muscles may become strong again, allowing you to resume eating. This waxing-and-waning weakness of muscles, worsening with use and improving with rest, is a hallmark of this particular disease. There typically are periods when you may notice more symptoms (called an exacerbation), interspersed with periods when your symptoms decrease or disappear (remission). The disease most commonly affects muscles that control eye and eyelid movement, so the first symptoms you notice may be eyelid drooping and\/or blurred or doubled vision. Many myasthenia gravis patients start out with this \"ocular myasthenia.\" The majority will go on to develop weakness in other muscle groups within one or two years. Myasthenia gravis affecting multiple muscle groups throughout the body is called generalized myasthenia gravis. Other common muscle groups that are affected may make it difficult for you to chew, swallow, smile, shrug, lift your arm up, grip, rise to a stand, or walk up stairs. When the muscles necessary for breathing are affected, a patient is said to be in myasthenic crisis. This is a life-threatening situation. Though anyone can develop myasthenia gravis, those most likely to do so are women between age 20 and 40 or men between 50 and 70. If a woman with myasthenia gravis gives birth, the baby may have some temporary, but potentially life-threatening, muscle weakness (neonatal myasthenia) because of antibodies that have transferred from the mother\\'s bloodstream. Typically, during the baby\\'s first weeks of life, the antibodies are cleared from the baby\\'s circulation and the baby develops normal muscle tone and strength.

Some possible surgical complications may include general anesthesia problems, excessive bleeding, infection, and even a collapsed lung. So why would an individual agree to having the operation completed?...most likely because the potential surgical benefits may outweigh the possible risks. Myasthenia Gravis attacks the central nervous system through immune system malfunctioning causing muscle weakness. With removal of the thymus gland, the disease process may go into a state of remission (not cured). Also, with removal of the diseased thymus, the immune system may operate more efficiently, and weakened muscles may regain some of their lost strength. Short term complications from a Thymectomy do occur and may present symptoms such as difficulty in breathing, fever, and chest pain. I suggest that you find a competent surgeon who completes at least 3 - 4 thymus removals per year. Listen to the doctor closely as that person describes the surgical procedure along with the expected risks and benefits. As for myself, after feeling confident about the doctor\\'s ability and knowledgeable about Myasthenia Gravis, I would probably would have the operation in order to stop the disease from causing more damage.

A new study shows that this particular effect of jet lag may linger longer than we realize. Researchers at The University of California, at Berkeley, conducted an interesting experiment. They used an animal model in which they compared the performance and memory tasks of jet-lagged hamsters against a control group. The researchers learned that jet lag affects the part of the brain responsible for memory and learning: * It limits the growth of brain cells and reduces brain activity. * It leads to memory and learning problems. * Even a month after recovering, subjects were still suffering from its effects. Lance Kriegsfeld, UC Berkley associate professor of psychology and study author, commented: What this says is that, whether you are a flight attendant, medical resident, or rotating shift worker, repeated disruption of circadian rhythms is likely going to have a long-term impact on your cognitive behavior and function. I could not agree with him more. Anyone who travels or works a rotating shift can experience jet lag and not even realize it. Since this was an animal experiment, we cant ask the participants if they noticed feeling any different, or if they had any difficulty learning something new. Even so, this study sheds light on some astounding implications of jet lag for various professionals: * Pilots learning new flight routes. * Medical residents practicing new surgical techniques or recognizing unfamiliar states of diseases. * Shift workers dealing with different job responsibilities, rotations, or assembly methods. Jet lag could be the cause of many simple errors. I have written about jet lag before; jet lag is usually the result of crossing several time zones in a short period of time, without allowing for your body to time to adjust for the changes in time. Your body will typically adjust at the rate of one to two time zones per day; so if you cross six time zones, your body will naturally make the adjustment to the time change in about three to five days. Though shift workers may not physically cross over time zones, their days and nights fluctuate according to their work schedule, which throws off their biological clock. Whether you are traveling across the country, or picking up a holiday shift, here are some simple things to help fight jet lag (keep your brain healthy): 1. Time your flights. If you are only flying over two to three zones, avoid the red eye flights as much as possible. Remember, jet lag is worse if you traveling east. 2. Get outside and get some sunlight! Light helps re-set your circadian rhythm and reduces the effects of jet lag. 3. Adjust with exercise. Exercise also helps re-set your biological clock. I would not suggest running a marathon, but while you are outside getting sunlight, consider taking a brisk walk. 4. Avoid alcohol and caffeine. Both will negatively affect your sleep cycle, which will already be slightly off. 5. Resist napping on the plane. You may need to fall asleep earlier than your body is used to at your new destination. Being a little more tired could be helpful. 6. Melatonin might not be the best answer; the studies on its effectiveness are mixed. ... Melatonin often comes in an overdose amount  were talking anything over 1 mg. Its important to check with your doctor before taking this hormone. 7. Consider a jet lag calculator app. These can help guide you through overcoming and preventing jet lag.

Thats the key word when it comes to jet lag, and for good reason. When your internal clock doesnt match the external clock, it can be - and feel - like World War III in your body. The problems that arise with jet lag are a clear example of how external influences can disrupt our internal body clock. So what can you do to prevent the jet lag from making your trip a drag? How about setting your body clock to a new time zone before the journey? By using light therapy or an alarm clock that simulates dawn and dusk with techniques to induce sleep, you can reset your circadian body clock before a journey, thus preventing jet lag from the very start. If you are planning a trip across more than two time zones and want to get accustomed to your destinations time zone quickly, this might be an approach to take. Lets say you have an important business trip for which you have to fly east. Before flying, youd go to bed and wake up earlier each day while using a light box in the morning and winding down earlier in the evening. If youre traveling west, you would expose yourself to bright light later in the day, go to bed later and wake up a little later in the morning. If you dont have the time or inclination to get a light box, then consider direct sunlight as the next-best alternative. Light boxes, while producing artificial light that mimics the suns intensity, dont emit ultraviolet radiation. They are designed to produce those perfect wavelengths of light (peaking in the optimal blue wavelength range, or 460 nanometers) and the light gets directed angularly at your eyes for the greatest effect. If you can shift your body clock naturally prior to departing, this can be a particularly useful technique if your trip doesnt allow for much time to adjust before kicking into high gear and demanding your top performance. Try and switch over to your new time zone right away by going to bed and getting up at the same time you would normally, but on this new time zone. So if you usually go to bed at 10 p.m. in L.A., do the same the first night you land in New York even though your body might think its only 7 p.m. Then, the next morning try and go for a walk outside, exposing yourself to light and movement that can help re-set your internal clock. And take my Travelers Survivor Kit with you: * Ear plugs. * Eye mask. * Favorite soothing music and head phones or a device like an iPod. * C-shaped pillow that fits around your neck. These strategies can also be used for shift workers.

Researchers found that one of the earliest symptoms of Parkinsons may be a REM sleep disorder known as REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD). There are a few things that happen with RBD: Usually when we sleep, the body shuts down our muscle movement during REM sleep so that we cant act out our dreams In people with RBD, this shut-down doesnt happen In this case, people have dreams that are very vivid and violent, compelling them to talk, punch, kick, scream, and even jump out of bed. Interestingly, RBD is usually seen in middle-aged to elderly people, and is more likely to happen in men than in women. This highly active dreaming can appear up to eight years before the onset of other symptoms of Parkinsons, so researchers are eager to see if they can use this to help patients before the disease becomes too severe. The next step is for scientists to see if RBD is always a sign of Parkinsons or if active dreaming could be a benign trait. In addition to being a possible early sign of Parkinsons, RBD prevents people from getting restful sleep, mostly because they are so active during their dreams.

Stacy","membervotes":"0"},{"descr":null,"questionId":"1173413","followers":null,"ans":"Several genes have now been definitively linked to Parkinson\\'s disease. The first to be identified was alpha-synuclein. In the 1990s, researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other institutions studied the genetic profiles of a large Italian family and three Greek families with familial Parkinson\\'s disease and found that their disease was related to a mutation in this gene. They found a second alpha-synuclein mutation in a German family with Parkinson\\'s disease. These findings prompted studies of the role of alpha-synuclein in Parkinson\\'s disease, which led to the discovery that Lewy bodies from people with the sporadic form of Parkinson\\'s disease contained clumps of alpha-synuclein protein. This discovery revealed a potential link between hereditary and sporadic forms of the disease. Researchers studying inherited Parkinson\\'s disease discovered that the disease in one large family was caused by a triplication of the normal alpha-synuclein gene on one copy of chromosome 4. This triplication caused people in the affected family to produce too much of the normal alpha-synuclein. The study showed that an excess of the normal form of the protein could result in Parkinson\\'s disease, just as the abnormal form does. Other genes linked to Parkinson\\'s disease include parkin, DJ-1, PINK1, and LRRK2. Parkin, DJ-1, and PINK-1 cause rare, early onset forms of Parkinson\\'s disease. The parkin gene is translated into a protein that normally helps cells break down and recycle proteins. DJ-1 normally helps regulate gene activity and protect cells from oxidative stress. PINK1 codes for a protein active in mitochondria. Mutations in this gene appear to increase susceptibility to cellular stress. LRRK2, which is translated into a protein called dardarin, was originally identified in several English and Basque families and causes a late-onset form of Parkinson\\'s disease. Subsequent studies have identified this gene in other families with Parkinson\\'s disease, as well as in a small percentage of people with apparently sporadic Parkinson\\'s disease. Researchers are continuing to investigate the normal functions and interactions of these genes in order to find clues about how Parkinson\\'s disease develops. They also have identified a number of other genes and chromosome regions that may play a role in Parkinson\\'s disease, but the nature of these links is not yet clear.

These tricks alone probably wont work in older kids without some modifications. You can start these sleep-training ideas at any time. If getting a solid nights sleep is a priority, the younger you start training, the better. First: Baby has to get enough calories during the day. Nurse frequently (at least every 2-3 hours by day), and start solid complementary foods at 4-6 months (earlier is not better). As babies get to 3-4 months of age, they will be able to go longer between day feedings. Dont let them stretch out the day feeds until the night is one solid block of sleep. Second: You must back off on reacting to every little noise babies make as they sleep. You will stir a bit, baby will fuss a bit, and youre both wide awake. Thats a habit that needs to stop. As soon as you feel comfortable, move your baby to his or her own room so you dont keep waking each other up. If baby wakes and makes a little noise, dont rush in immediately. Take your time. At least sometimes, Baby will put herself back to sleep without your going to see her. Give her a chance to soothe herself before rushing to tend to her. Third (and this is the hardest part for many families): Baby must learn to fall asleep all alone. If youre holding, rocking, or feeding a baby while he falls asleep and then sneak away, the baby  guaranteed  will wake up again later that night and need you to come back. Good rules of thumb: By two months of age, you should sometimes be putting your baby down when awake; By four months of age, you should usually be putting your baby down awake; By six months of age: always put your baby down while awake. Some babies will make this easy, essentially sleep training themselves. Other babies will fight sleep and make this a more difficult transition. Exactly when to sleep train is a personal decision, depending on the parents plans and priorities.

Its the question every parent of a newborn gets. How well does he or she sleep at night? And every new parent asks the other, related question: When will my baby sleep through the night? Ever? (Never?) No two babies are alike. Thats true when it comes to sleep, as well. Ive heard from parents whose babies sleep, well, like a baby  through the night  as early as six weeks old. And then there are those parents who still struggle to get a full night of uninterrupted sleep more than a year after their babys birth. What gives? In the first few weeks of life, babies dont have a circadian rhythm going yet which helps them to know the difference between daylight and nighttime. This rhythm, or body clock, starts ticking at around six weeks of age. But whats more critical to the sleep rhythms of infants is their need for nourishment. In other words, its not so much that babies are missing the on and off switch that adults have when it comes to day-and-night cycles. Its that babies cannot hold enough food (i.e., breast milk or formula) in their bellies to get through the night without needing more calories for growth. It takes a baby a few months to grow a belly big enough to accommodate enough calories so they may rest for longer periods without needing to fill up again. And because breast milk, in particular, gets digested more quickly than formula, moms who exclusively breastfeed typically find themselves tending to their tots more frequently than those who are formula-fed. But heres some good news for new parents who worry that they may be doomed to years of sleeplessness: A new study published in the journal Pediatrics and done by researchers from the University of Canterbury, New Zealand, states that by the age of 5 months, over 50 percent of all infants are following their parents sleeping times  and sleeping right through the night. Sound too good to be true? Well, this also means that 50 percent of infants are not following their parents sleeping schedules and are not sleeping through the night. Theres a difference between a baby matching his or her parents sleeping schedule and sleeping through the night. The researchers noted that achieving non-stop sleep does not take that long, but its coinciding with the parents schedule takes longer. For example, a baby who sleeps for six straight hours but does so from 6 pm to midnight, is not going to please most parents who would prefer to go to bed at 10 and get up at 6. But a baby who sleeps for six straight hours from, say 11 p.m. to 5 a.m., may be a lot easier to handle than a baby who has a parent (or both) up in the dead middle of the night. Despite the statistics, sometimes babies just dont comply with whats considered average or normal. And sometimes you just have to stick it out until your baby gets on the same playing field as you. Hopefully thats sooner rather than later. But there are a few things you can try to get your little one to fall into that first 50 percent category  the 50 percent of infants who sleep relatively well through the night. Here they are: * Get a.m. light: Make sure your baby gets a dose of morning light. This will help set the body clock up, and reset a body clock that may be ticking a tad off schedule. * Preserve nap time: Babies nap routinely throughout the day, usually once in the morning, and another in the afternoon. Though you may be tempted to cut back on nap time in order to save sleep time for the night, this will backfire. Babies who get the full extent of their naps in, sleep better than those whose naps are cut short. And they just might grow up smarter, thanks to their naps. * Cluster feed: To overcome the challenge of keeping your babys belly satiated through the night, see if you can feed him in small clusters in the evening hours and then top-off his belly close to bedtime so he goes to sleep with a full belly. That way, he or she is less likely to wake up within a couple of hours hungry. * Try the eat, sleep, play method: We used this method in our house and found it to be extremely helpful. The key here is consistency in the schedule: If it is sleep time and you are out, get home and get them to bed, it will pay off. And for those who try everything and nothing works, consult your pediatrician, there could be reflux (sometimes called colic), or any number of digestive disorders that could be waking your baby. Then be patient. One night, your baby will surprise you. Youll wake up to the sound of nothing and worry that something happened to him or her. As you rush to the crib to check on your little one, you realize that all is well. All are asleep. And so should you be, too.

I have read that airlines will not allow a baby to fly that is less than 1 week old. I have also read some health care professionals say that babies as young as 2 weeks old can fly if needed. However, since women are at increased risk for blood clots following delivery, it may be best to wait a little while longer than 1 or 2 weeks for both mother\\'s health and the baby\\'s health. Bottom line: if there is a compelling need to fly with your baby, it can be done very early, but you are likely best off waiting for at least 4 - 8 weeks.

Although there are equations to calculate BMR, such as the Harris-Benedict equation, these are all theoretical estimations and your actual number could vary. There are other, more accurate methods to calculate your BMR through either direct or indirect calorimetry techniques that usually measure gas exchange between oxygen consumption and CO2 production. You could do an internet search to find test facilities near you for these methods if youre genuinely curious, otherwise the BMR equations might give you a good enough estimate. Youre correct in stating that 1,200 calories is typically the conventional lower threshold value given and I think that its fair to use as an estimate for most of the general population (again, your actual number will vary). By far, however, 800 calories per day would be considered a very low calorie diet (VLCD) because it would be very hard to meet your nutritional needs with so few calories. This type of diet would generally not be recommended for individuals who are not obese and who dont have proper medical supervision. Your doctor will take your specific circumstances into consideration before helping you decide if you should go on a VLCD and you may need to work with a dietitian to develop a specific eating plan to help ensure that you meet your nutrient needs while following the diet. Its important to note that although VLCDs have been shown to lower weight and help with obesity-related conditions like hypertension, diabetes, or high cholesterol in obese individuals; they dont seem to be any more effective than a more modest dietary eating plan long term. You will likely regain any weight loss after going off the VLCD unless you transition into a healthy eating plan while incorporating regular exercise, which is another aspect of why medical supervision from your doctor or a dietitian would be essential.

Using the calculator, I entered your height as 5\\'10\" and your activity level as \"extremely active.\" This indicates you need about 3100 calories a day merely to maintain your current weight.

Creatinine is a natural product of muscle breakdown that occurs at a low level in the body. Both BUN and creatinine are filtered by the kidney and excreted in urine. For this reason, BUN and creatinine are used together to measure kidney function. If kidney function begins to decline, BUN and creatinine rise. A normal creatinine depends on muscle mass and age. In general, a normal creatine is 0.5 to 1.2 milligrams per deciliter (mg\/dL). A normal BUN is 7 to 20 mg\/dL. Remember that different laboratories use different testing equipment, and may have slightly different ranges for normal. A small, temporary increase in either BUN or creatinine can occur during illness or dehydration; the numbers usually return to normal during recovery. In cases of dehydration, BUN may increase in a higher proportion than the creatinine. A normal BUN-to-creatinine ratio is between 10 to 1 and 20 to 1. (For example, a BUN of 14 and a creatinine of 1.2 would be a ratio of 12.) In cases of dehydration, the BUN-to-creatinine ratio may be higher than 20 to 1, as the kidney responds by making the urine more concentrated. Other conditions that cause BUN-to-creatinine ratio to rise are kidney disease, kidney stones, or bleeding in the intestines. Low BUN-to-creatinine can occur in pregnancy, liver disease, or a diet low in protein. The BUN-to-creatinine ratio is not a precise or reliable test, though. It may often be somewhat abnormal in healthy people. More important is the creatinine level itself; if its elevated, the kidneys are not working properly, and the reason should be sought out.

(In the metric system, a milligram is a unit of weight equal to one-thousandth of a gram, and a deciliter is a unit of volume equal to one-tenth of a liter.) Muscular young or middle-aged adults may have more creatinine in their blood than the norm for the general population. Elderly persons, on the other hand, may have less creatinine in their blood than the norm. Infants have normal levels of about 0.2 or more, depending on their muscle development. In people with malnutrition, severe weight loss, and longstanding illnesses the muscle mass tends to diminish over time and, therefore, their creatinine level may be lower than expected for their age. A person with only one kidney may have a normal level of about 1.8 or 1.9. Creatinine levels that reach 2.0 or more in babies and 10.0 or more in adults may indicate severe kidney impairment and the need for a dialysis machine to remove wastes from the blood.

Those of us in the clinical trenches know that symptoms and signs are not necessarily predictive of a definitive diagnosis. A recent two-year study in Finland looked at 469 children, ages 6-35 months, and tested the predictive value of common middle ear infection symptoms: ear-rubbing or pulling, irritability, less playful, excessive crying, poor appetite, restless sleep, runny nose, congestion, vomiting, diarrhea and fever. The diagnosis of a middle ear infection (otitis media) requires a certain diagnostic criteria: Middle ear fluid detected by pneumatic otoscopy  this is the little bulb syringe attached to the otoscope that puffs air against the eardrum to check for mobility (the normal in and out movement of the eardrum). Abnormal color, opacity, bulging (shape) of the eardrum. Middle ear infections are typically bulging and have a distinct red or yellow color, instead of shiny white. In this study, not one, but three different physicians systematically examined the ears of children strongly suspected by the parents as having a middle ear infection based on symptoms alone. The results: The duration and severity of the symptoms were NOT predictive of a middle ear infection. Ear-rubbing and pulling, long thought to be predictive of ear pain, was proven to be an invalid sign. It was actually more common in children who did NOT have a middle ear infection. Fever was also NOT a predictive sign. A prior cold was NOT a predictive sign in this study, although statistically most children who get middle ear infection usually do have a cold. Conjunctivitis (pink eye) may be a presumptive sign in some, not all, cases. The only definitive way to diagnose a child with a middle ear infection is by a careful, systematic medical examination by an experienced clinician using a pneumatic otoscope. I see these false alarms nearly every day in my clinical practice. Parents believe their children have an ear infection, when in reality, they do not. Many parents will still demand antibiotics just in case, or come up with some compelling stories like going out of town tomorrow, a seriously ill grandparent or upcoming air travel in an effort to plead their case. Cursory or incomplete examinations by hurried clinicians tend to over-read ear examination findings, resulting in inaccurate diagnoses. I find this quite often in emergency room or urgent care visits. Here are 10 facts about ear infection: 1. Not all middle ear infections in children (not including babies under the age of three months) require antibiotics. As a matter of fact, over 90 percent of middle ear infections will self-resolve in a few days on their own, without any medical intervention. Shocking. It is perfectly fine to wait a few days to see if the bodys immune system orchestrates the cure. 2. Middle ear infections hurt. Regardless of the presence of fever (harmless), a child in pain should be treated with acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) at an appropriate dose for the pain not the fever. 3. Fever is harmless and does not need to be treated in most cases. 4. Middle ear infections are not emergencies. They really have no place in the emergency room. 5. Not all recurrent ear infection will result in children getting tubes. However, if middle ear fluid is present for more than three months and\/or children are having hearing loss, an ENT specialist should be consulted. 6. Children in daycare get more ear infections. The fall and winter months have the highest incidence. 7. Children exposed to ANY secondary cigarette smoke get more ear infections. (If you smoke around your children, you should be arrested.) 8. Children who are breast-fed for at least six months get less ear infections that bottle-fed babies. 9. Children who have a nighttime bottle in the crib or depend on a pacifier tend to have more ear infections. 10. Children do grow out of ear infections. We see a marked reduction after age six, so hang in there. Now, go buy a home otoscope and start practicing.

Well, guess what, everyone? Unfortunately, many of you are quite wrong, and I will explain why. We know that low HDL cholesterol (good cholesterol) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. It is included in the most well-known risk factor scoring system for cardiovascular disease called the Framingham scoring. Surprisingly, there is little clinical evidence that therapies directed at raising HDL cholesterol reduce risk. I will say that again, there is little evidence that raising ones good cholesterol number protects them from having a heart attack, a stroke, or dying. For this reason, the National Cholesterol Education Panel (NCEP) does not specify a number that would be the optimal HDL level of therapy. NCEP also states that raising ones HDL is not a primary or secondary goal of therapy in order to reduce cardiovascular events or death. NCEP ATP-III statements about low HDL cholesterol were published in the journal Circulation in 2002. Here is a selection of facts from the article: * A categorical low HDL-C should be defined as a level of less than 40 mg\/dL, in both men and women. * Whether raising HDL per se will reduce risk for CHD has not been resolved. (Still true in 2010.) * Some persons with severe deficiency of HDL do not manifest premature coronary heart disease; this suggests that HDL is not uniquely involved in atherogenesis (clogging of the arteries), as is LDL cholesterol (the bad cholesterol). * A specific HDL cholesterol goal level to reach with HDL raising therapy is not identified. In summary, when we measure HDL cholesterol, we are just measuring a number that tells us nothing about how well it functions. There is no way yet to measure how well ones HDL functions, and thus, if ones level is within normal limits, does the person with a higher HDL number have fewer events than a person with lower HDL number? This has never shown to be true in any randomized prospective human studies. This is also defined in scientific terms as no Level 1 evidence. There is only data in retrospective and epidemiological studies that show that the higher the HDL cholesterol number the lower the cardiovascular event rate. I will put another twist in the HDL discussion. There is a level at which the HDL cholesterol in some people may be too high and dysfunctional, and actually be harmful to the arteries. There is another group of people whose HDL is called ApoA1 Milano, who are all originally from Limone, Italy, and have very low levels of HDL cholesterol. Approximately 3.5 percent of these people have HDL levels below 10mg\/dl and have virtually no evidence of cardiovascular disease whatsoever. This is a kind of super HDL. The bottom line is that in most people, low HDL cholesterol is bad and is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, but a high level may not be protective. The name of the game is to get the LDL cholesterol (the bad cholesterol) down. If anybody is really curious about this point, they can take a look at the Heart and Estrogen Replacement Study. In this study, 20 percent of the women who had heart attacks had HDL cholesterol levels in the 60-80 mg\/dl range, which is well above normal.

They have mistakenly believed that the total cholesterol number is the goal of therapy. Thus, it has become pretty much dogma that patients memorize their total cholesterol number so they can compare it with friends or tell their doctor. Surprisingly, lowering ones total cholesterol is not even mentioned by the National Cholesterol Education Panel (NCEP) ATP III as a goal of cholesterol management. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) launched the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) in November 1985. The goal of the NCEP is to reduce illness and death from coronary heart disease (CHD) in the United States by reducing the percent of Americans with high blood cholesterol. In 1988, the first guidelines from the first Adult Treatment Panel of NCEP, which was called NCEP ATP I, were published. Since that time, many studies were published and guidelines have been updated. ATP II was published in 1993, and ATP III issued an evidence-based set of guidelines on cholesterol management in 2001. Since this publication, five major clinical trials of statin therapy were published and addressed issues that were not examined in previous clinical trials of cholesterol-lowering therapy. Thus,in 2004,an ATP III addendum was published with revised guidelines. These guidelines are currently used by physicians to treat high cholesterol levels. The next set of guidelines, called ATP IV, are scheduled to be published in the fall of 2011. Although physicians still talk about total cholesterol levels, all the ATPs have lowering LDL cholesterol (the bad cholesterol) as the primary target of therapy and have never once mentioned total cholesterol! The truth is that prior to ATP I, based on the data from the famous MRFIT trial, it was shown that those patients with a total cholesterol greater than 200mg\/dl were at increased risk of a cardiovascular event and those with a level less than 200mg\/dl at a lower risk. Apparently, in the evolution of understanding lipid management and therapy, it was incorrectly stated that a magic cholesterol level of 200mg\/dl or less was the goal of therapy.

Nuts are a wonderful source of high quality fats and protein. And now we know they\\'ll help keep your cholesterol under control as well. Researchers at Loma Linda University found that folks who consumed about 2.5 ounces of nuts throughout the day decreased their total cholesterol by an average of 5.1%, and reduced their bad cholesterol LDL by 7.4% and a whopping 10.4% decrease in trigylerides only if they were elevated to start with. The scientists found that you got your biggest bang for your nut-buck if your bad cholesterol LDL was high to start with and if you were consuming a typical high fat Western diet. In other words, if your diet is great and your cholesterol is normal, you\\'ll be preventing problems, but you won\\'t see big changes in your numbers since they\\'re normal to start with. The folks with higher numbers and junky diets see the biggest changes.

This act states that marketed dietary supplements cannot contain a compound already approved as a drug (in this case, lovastatin) unless the substance was available commercially before the drug\\'s approval. At present, Cholestin is still available in Canada, Europe, and Asia; however, great caution should be exercised because Cholestin has been reformulated and no longer contains the important red yeast rice extract, but rather polymethoxylated flavones extracted from citrus fruits, geraniol, and marine fish oils.

Those include: * Children who have a parent or grandparent diagnosed with heart disease at or under 55 years of age. * Children who have a parent or grandparent who have had a heart attack, heart-related chest pain, vascular disease or sudden cardiac death at or under 55 years of age. * Children who have a parent with an elevated blood cholesterol level of 240 mg\/dl or higher. * Children who are diagnosed with obesity.

Boredom with regular sexual routines also may contribute to a lack of enthusiasm for sex, as can lifestyle factors, such as careers and the care of children. Inability to become aroused: For women, the inability to become physically aroused during sexual activity often involves insufficient vaginal lubrication.

Other factors contributing to anorgasmia include insufficient stimulation, certain medications, and chronic diseases.

Most types of sexual problems can be corrected by treating the underlying physical or psychological problems. Other treatment strategies focus on the following: Providing education. Education about human anatomy, sexual function, and the normal changes associated with aging, as well as sexual behaviors and responses, may help a woman overcome her anxieties about sexual function and performance. Enhancing stimulation. This may include the use of erotic materials (videos or books), masturbation, and changes to sexual routines. Providing distraction techniques. Erotic or non-erotic fantasies, exercises with intercourse, music, videos, or television can be used to increase relaxation and eliminate anxiety. Encouraging non-coital behaviors. Non-coital behaviors (physically stimulating activity that does not include intercourse), such as sensual massage, can be used to promote comfort and increase communication between partners. Minimizing pain. Using sexual positions that allow the woman to control the depth of penetration may help relieve some pain. The use of vaginal lubricants can help reduce pain caused by friction, and a warm bath before intercourse can help increase relaxation.

Fever is most prevalent as a response in the younger crowd. The older we get, the less often we get fevers to help us get better. Fever is good and should not be feared, no matter what grandma told you, or what you have heard. Fever is just a sign, not a disease. School authorities will exclude children since they have no idea what the child is biologically cooking. If children have a contagious illness, the fever stage  those first few days of an illness  would be time when they are most contagious. With that said, exposure to an infectious disease, like a common cold or even strep, does not necessarily imply that the person exposed will get it. Many schools and day care facilities require that a child be fever-free for 24 hours before coming back to the herd. This is probably a reasonable parameter, but 24 hours after getting back into that classroom, the child can get another viral infection and the dance will continue. There are no rules that a child with one viral infection cant get another. Many kids, especially those new to school or day care, will seem to have one, continuous cold, lasting months. In reality, they have had many, overlapping (coalescing) viral infections during this period  a new cold starting before the first one went away. Some fever facts: * Kids will be excluded from school or day care with fever. Period. Schools set their own rules, whether we necessarily agree with them or not. * Fever in kids will cost you a lot of missed days at work. Period. * Fever is the bodys normal response to fighting off an illness  a good thing. It does not require treatment unless the child is uncomfortable. * Lowering body temperature does not shorten the course of an illness; if anything, it may prolong it. * Fevers that occur early in a viral illness are expected and should be welcomed. Fevers later in an illness may be a sign of a secondary infection. * Keep your cool. Fever is a sign, not a disease. Statistically, fevers in kids indicate a viral infection; but not always.

As a matter of fact, fever helps fight infection so it is more therapeutic than dangerous. Fevers under 105 in older children is not uncommon. Any fever in babies under 6 months are taken more seriously, but as the child ages, seasoned medical providers do not get excited...certainly not as excited about fever as parents. I have been treating children for over four decades and I have not encountered a fever (alone) that would prompt an ER visit, but of course, that is me. It is not the fever that is the issue but rather the CAUSE of the fever and those other symptoms that accompany the fever. For instance, a fever with a severe sore throat could be Strep, or a fever with a dozen other cold symptoms could just mean a viral infection. A fever with lethargy, stiff neck, and a very ill-appearing child could be meningitis. Roseola, a common childhood illness, can mount a fever in the 105 range for three days in a row before the characteristic rash appears. During the fever stage, this high temp certainly gets attention. Fever is probably one of the most misunderstood and improperly treated symptoms (it is not a disease) that people encounter, so the more your read about it, the better you will be informed, and the more comfortable you will be when you see it again....and again....and again.

If, in fact, you have moved from hypothyroidism to hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid gland), your healthcare provider will discuss ways of treating this condition.

Tonsillitis is inflammation of the tonsils, which is usually due to infection by viruses or bacteria. Doctors more often use the term pharyngitis, or inflammation of the pharynx (throat). In most cases of pharyngitis, the tonsils are also infected and inflamed. Most cases of pharyngitis and tonsillitis are caused by viruses. These include the viruses that cause the common cold and influenza (flu), and less common viruses such as those that cause mononucleosis. The most common bacterium causing pharyngitis is Streptoccocus pyogenes, the bacterium that causes strep throat. Many other less common bacteria can also cause pharyngitis. Whether caused by viruses or bacteria, pharyngitis and tonsillitis are spread by close person-to-person contact. The contagious period varies between people and the exact bug thats causing the infection. Strep throat is usually no longer contagious 24 hours after a person starts taking antibiotics. Some viruses causing pharyngitis may be contagious for more than a week, even after a person feels better. In cases of strep throat, its a good idea to discard the ill persons toothbrush and thoroughly rinse any oral appliances for a few days after starting antibiotics. Since its not usually possible to know if its a virus causing tonsillitis or pharyngitis, its safest to avoid intimate contact (such as kissing) for about a week after recovery.

Definition of Pulmonary Hypertension: Pulmonary Hypertension represents high blood pressure within the blood vessels of the lung. It can lead to dizziness, fainting, shortness of breath, and numerous other symptoms. Pulmonary Hypertension is grouped into different classifications based upon the suspected cause and systems that are involved. Here is a brief break-down of those classifications: Classification and Causes: - Left sided heart disease that may be caused by anemia, HIV infection, congenital abnormalities, and other reasons. - Lung disease that may be caused by COPD or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Sleep Disorders, High Altitudes, and other reasons. - Unclear and undifferentiated multi- system reasons such as removal of the spleen and thyroid disease. - And other classes with various causes. Diagnosis: As you can see, Pulmonary Hypertension is a complex disease. Proper diagnosis may require much testing and the cooperative efforts of physicians specializing in pulmonology, cardiology, immunology, and others. Treatment: Treatment may be in the form of surgery and\/or medications. Surgical procedures may include removal of the spleen, re-communicating blood vessel contact within the lung, and lung transplantation. Depending on the reason(s) for pulmonary hypertension, prescribed medications may be numerous. Prognosis: The prognosis for P.E. since the advent of newer medications is presently more hopeful than even just a few years ago.

Pancreatic disease took his life at the age of 58. I share his story hoping that others will benefit. Paul was a police officer for a large USA city. He kept himself in good shape & never complained. He was a respected husband and father who rarely drank alcohol. He had retired from United States Navy 2 years before his death achieving the rank of Master Chief with 32 years of service. He served in Iraq for over a year even though he didn\\'t have to serve. He felt that it was his obligation and privilege to give back to his country. He coached his kids baseball and soccer teams, told jokes to all that would listen, volunteered for his church, donated money like it was water to Saint Jude\\'s Hospital, and helped his family and neighbors without being asked. The gates of heaven were surely open for Paul. My brother was Christmas shopping after work and suddenly experienced upper abdominal pain that was unbearable in intensity. He was taken by ambulance to a hospital, spent almost 6 months in treatment and died a painful death. His blood sugar upon admission soared to over 500 even though he was not a diabetic. His abdomen grew to the size of a giant butterball turkey. Eventually he was given insulin and diagnosed with pancreatitis. His pancreases was surgically removed and his diet limited to ice chips. His weight plummeted to about 90 lbs., the pain never left his body, and his death became almost a blessing. Pancreatic disease is sometimes called the silent killer with good reason. My brother was not a drinker, took excellent care of his body, and apparently had no symptomology. In the end, none of his positive qualities helped him to win the fight against this ugly villain, pancreatitis. Perhaps Paul did have some of the symptoms listed above and ignored their significance. He presented the image of a tough guy with a heart of gold who would never be caught complaining. If you, a family member, or a friend have any of the listed symptoms above, please consider seeing a doctor immediately for evaluation. Your family would surely rather hear you complaining but eventually feeling well, than to witness you dying a slow, painful death and to be left only with a pile of good memories of you as a person.

It is apparent that you are very concerned. It is difficult to answer your question based upon the limited information provided. Talking about a cure is not possible due to the many different case scenarios that may cause the pancreatitis to return. Some questions that I had included: How old is your daughter? Pancreatitis in children is a rare occurrence. What were her symptoms? Was she admitted to the hospital from the ER? Pancreatitis is a medical emergency usually requiring inpatient hospitalization. Was the diagnosis of pancreatitis reported as acute or chronic? Acute pancreatitis can become chronic pancreatitis. What was the cause (if one could be established) of the pancreatitis? Effective treatment and the prognosis of the disease can hinge on what factor brought about the condition. In the majority of the cases, but not all, excessive drinking of alcoholic beverages is a contributing factor. Sometimes a systematic infection is a predisposing reason as well as inherited factors. In roughly 20% of the cases, no cause can be determined. What treatment was provided to control her symptoms? In many cases narcotic medication is provided to control pain and food must be withheld. IV fluids and oxygen are routine measures used to stabilize the body during the crisis period. Sometimes insulin must be given to reduce soaring blood sugar levels. What instructions or physician orders were supplied upon your daughters ER and\/or hospital discharge? At the very least, she should be followed up medically by doctors specializing in endocrine conditions and pancreatic disease. The link below is from a WebMd article that will provide you with some basic pancreatitis information. http:\/\/www.webmd.com\/digestive-disorders\/digestive-diseases-pancreatitis In some cases pancreatitis may run its course without any lasting negative consequences. I hope that this is the case for your daughter. As a matter of reference, I lost my brother to acute pancreatitis at the age of 58 years old.

There are some differences, and one of the biggest ones is the fact that the spray comes out differently.

Pace yourself, slow down if you get out of breath, and keep moving. One method for beginners is a five-minute out, five-minute back plan. From your starting point, jog five minutes, turn around, and jog back five minutes. Done! Of course, not everyone can jog for 10 minutes to start, and that\\'s okay. Try an informal interval-training method as a way to get started if jogging straight for 10 minutes is beyond your ability. Keep in mind that the most important thing is just to get started. You can always add more later on. Here\\'s an interval plan that will get you started: If you stick with this method, you\\'ll find over time that you can increase the jogging intervals and decrease the walking intervals until you can jog for the entire 30 minutes. Formal training schedules If you prefer a more formal training program, you can organize your workout into specific intervals or ratios of work to active recovery (for example, work:active recovery). For instance, if you can jog for 30 minutes at 5.5 mph, try jogging for three minutes at that speed, then increase the speed to 6.0 mph and jog for one minute, then jog again for three minutes at your normal speed, then jog again at 6.0 mph for one minute, and so on until you reach your time limit. The work:active-recovery ratio in this example is 1:3. You can increase the work portion each week by 30 seconds and decrease the active-recovery time by 30 seconds, and if you follow that plan weekly, you will be jogging your whole workout at the faster speed before you know it. You can get even more specific and use your heart rate to determine your intervals. Heart rate is an excellent indication of how hard you are working. For example, if your heart rate at 5.5 mph is 70% of your predicted maximum, then start at that speed and increase either the speed, and\/or elevation if you\\'re on a treadmill, so that your heart rate increases to 85% for one minute, then back to your jogging speed that causes your heart to be at 70% of maximum for three minutes (1:3 ratio like the example above). Over time your conditioning will improve and then your heart rate will be lower at the higher speeds and you can spend more time at the higher speeds and less time in the active rest period. You can always vary the ratios if they turn out to be too hard or too easy. A good starting ratio is 1:3. Stretching Although there is no persuasive research to show that stretching will prevent injuries, it does feel good, and that may be reason enough to stretch. Go ahead and stretch your calves, quadriceps, hamstrings, and low back, before and after your runs, and see what you think. Where to run The good news is that you can run just about anywhere. Find a track or a trail in the woods or a route on the street near where you live. Running in another city when you\\'re traveling is a great way to see new sites and check out your environment. You can also call the local running club in the location you\\'re traveling to for tips on scenic places to run. You might also consider joining your own local running club. The camaraderie of running with others is nice; it can be fun, motivating, and can help you stick with it if you\\'re struggling a bit. It\\'s also good to be a club member if you\\'re looking for a training partner. Road races You might be interested in running in organized races. If so, check with your local running club for a race schedule near where you live. Road races are a great way to stay motivated, monitor your progress, and collect cool T-shirts as a trophy for your success. Road races come in many distances. There are 3.2 mile (a \"5K\" where K means kilometer), 5.0 mile, and 6.2 mile races (10K), as well as half marathons (13.1 miles) and marathons (26.2 miles). Most beginners should start with shorter races to get the feel of it and then tackle the longer ones. How fast do I run? You can determine your pace per mile by using a \"pace calculator.\" Many Web sites have them. ","votes":"151","membertype":"Expert","helpful":"150","title":"I want to start running.

Other possible symptoms of uterine cancer include non-bloody vaginal discharge, pelvic pain, unintentional weight loss, and feeling of a mass in the pelvis. You need to make an appointment with your gynecologist as soon as possible. The earlier uterine cancer is found, the greater the chances that it can be successfully treated. Talk to your gynecologist about your family history and changes in your periods. She will likely want to take a tissue sample with either an endometrial biopsy or a D&C .

Here is what\\'s different about these plans: Looser requirements: The requirement that you must demonstrate that you\\'ve been denied by insurers before applying has been lifted. That\\'s a big deal and saves both time and money for people interested in applying. Lower cost: The federal government runs the PCIP program in 23 states and Washington, D.C.

The private insurance market is notorious for shutting out people with pre-existing health conditions. Under health reform, however, you have new options: In July 2010, federally funded high-risk insurance pools, or the Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plans (PCIP), were set up to extend coverage for the medically uninsurable. The plans are intended to function as a bridge until 2014 when insurers can no longer deny coverage even to those who are sick. High Hopes Given the trouble people with health conditions have accessing insurance (the central issue around which the health-reform law was formed), the expectation was that the high-risk health plans would be flooded with applicants. That didn\\'t happen. In fact, enrollment has been extremely low; as of November, 2010, only about 8,000 people had enrolled. The numbers are growing ever so slightly, however. Kathleen Sebelius, secretary of the department of Health and Human Services (HHS), recently reported that 10,000 people are now enrolled in PCIP plans. In part, credit is being given to efforts by state and federal governments to better advertise the existence of these plans. If you have a pre-existing health condition and don\\'t know about, or have yet to look into the PCIPs, here\\'s your call to action. High-Risk Plan Details To qualify for a PCIP plan, you must be without health insurance coverage for at least six months. You also have to demonstrate that you\\'ve applied for and been denied coverage on the private insurance market, or were offered a plan that was unreasonably expensive. The program covers primary and specialty care, hospitalization, and prescription drugs. Preventive care is also covered at 100%, and you won\\'t be charged more because of your condition. At the start of 2011, HHS threw in some new plan options. You can choose among three: * Standard Plan. * Extended Plan. * HSA Plan (a tax-exempt Health Savings Account where you can deposit money to use for medical expenses). To review general differences in deductibles and in and out-of-network costs among the three plans check out https:\/\/www.pcip.gov\/PCIP_%20pamphlet_benefits_summary.pdf Signing Up PCIP is available in all states, although the programs vary: Some are run by states, while others are being administered by the federal Department of Health and Human Services. Check the government\\'s web site [https:\/\/www.pcip.gov\/StatePlans.html] for details by clicking on your state in a map of the country. You\\'ll be linked to a page with specific information about the high-risk plan where you live. And here\\'s where you can apply either online or by printing and filling out an application: https:\/\/www.pcip.gov\/Apply.html . Monthly premium costs will be based on your age and where you live, but the website will also give you a general guide as to the cost in your state. Take Another Look If you\\'ve looked into a high-risk plan before but decided against applying based on expense, take another look. This year, HHS slashed the federally run plans by about 20% in order to entice more folks to join.

COBRA Because you\\'ve had coverage through your employer, you would likely qualify for COBRA Continuation Coverage, which will extend your current health plan for 18 months. Once you\\'ve exhausted your COBRA benefits, you\\'re guaranteed by federal law to get a policy on the private insurance market.

Ungar, a Los Angeles-based health-care attorney. That relationship can make the difference between balance billing (not allowed) and billing you for a balance you owe (completely kosher). Is Your Doc In Or Out? A health-care provider who is in-network with your insurance company has negotiated a price for his or her medical services and signed a contract with your insurer agreeing to those rates as payment in-full. With the exception of your co-pay, deductible, or coinsurance, in-network providers generally cannot charge you more for their services. Doing so is considered balance billing, whether or not you\\'ve signed a form stating you\\'ll pay the balance of what your insurer won\\'t. But that\\'s not the end of the story. There are scenarios in which you may be required to pay beyond what your insurance company will, even if the doctor is in your carrier\\'s network. Duped by Details There are details consumers commonly overlook about the rules of their insurance coverage that cause trouble, says Marty Rosen, executive vice president and co-founder of Health Advocate, a healthcare advocacy and assistance organization. Forgetting the common requirement to pre-certify services before receiving care is a frequent mistake. Another is not confirming ahead of time whether you\\'re being treated by doctors in your insurance carrier\\'s network. \"Failure to do so may result in denial of coverage by your insurance company and thus, large out-of-pocket fees,\" Rosen says. Also watch for certain elements of a doctor\\'s visit that your insurance coverage may not cover, Ungar warns. For example, let\\'s say you see an in-network doctor for a routine colonoscopy. Both the doctor visit and the procedure may be fully covered by your insurer. But if your doctor decides to use a newer sedative that requires an anesthesiologist to administer it (as opposed to doing it herself), Unger says, you could be on the hook for the anesthesiologist\\'s charges. In order to avoid unnecessary health care costs before you get care: * Make sure the service you need is covered. * Determine exactly what the contracted service includes. * Confirm that the doctor is in your network. And don\\'t sign any documents you don\\'t understand or don\\'t feel comfortable with.

The virus can lie dormant for years, and then cause sores to erupt unexpectedly. As to who\\'s the culprit between you and your girlfriend in terms of who shared the virus, it\\'s impossible to say. You may have gotten the virus when you were a baby but never had an outbreak and then passed the virus to your girlfriend. Or she may have had the virus and has now passed it to you. Either way, if the two of you have been kissing while one of you has a cold sore, it\\'s a safe bet you\\'re both infected. So what does this mean? Well, in a certain way, not much. Like I said, a large number of people are infected with HSV-1. On the other hand, you each must be careful never to kiss the other\\'s genitals when you\\'re experiencing an active cold sore. This can actually cause the other person to get (HSV-2), which is an incurable sexually transmitted disease. It\\'s also annoying and can be embarrassing. People with genital herpes must avoid having any sexual contact during an outbreak. A condom is not necessarily adequate protection against HSV because it may not cover all the skin areas that can come in contact with a lesion. Hope this helps!

I had a grandmother who made really unappetizing potato cakes when I was growing up, so I discounted them for years. What Ive come to realize is that they can be a healthy, fantastic side dish to almost any meal. I had potato cakes on the menu this weekend with our fish special at Catellis Restaurant and they were so delicious, versatile, and surprisingly, healthy. First, start with organic Yukon gold potatoes, or sweet potatoes, or a combination of the two. Decide if you want to add vegetables like shredded zucchini. I start by shredding the potatoes on a blade in the Cuisinart or by grating them on a box grater. Next, take a bowl and toss the potatoes with fresh herbs. There are plenty that add great flavor rosemary and thyme are two of my favorites. Add savories like shallot, onion and garlic. (I like to saut my finely chopped onion and garlic first in a bit of extra virgin olive oil and a pinch of hot pepper flakes.) Put the shredded potatoes, herbs and vegetable in a bowl and fold in the cooked onions and garlic. Then, season with salt and cracked black pepper. Heat the oven 450 degrees. From there, line a baking sheet with parchment paper, and for each cake, make about a cupcake-size mass. Spread them out equally on the sheet pan. Drizzle a bit more olive oil on top for extra browning, and then bake for about 15-20 minutes. These cakes, a great side dish with all proteins, are really simple to make. They make weeknight meals into something more interesting and you can be as creative or simple as you want. A few additional ideas: Add cilantro and chopped jalapeno for a Latin flair. Add some Parmesan and extra garlic to a cake with rosemary. Crushed coriander and some curry powder can lend to Indian flavors. Whatever you choose to do, have fun with it.

Their Academy of Pediatrics has recently proposed a ban on junk food and beverage TV ads aimed at kids, a stiff tax on sugary items, and a requirement that fast food restaurants be located far away from schools. But this BMJ analysis takes the discussion to a different and understandably more contentious place. Should parents be blamed for their childs obesity? Intrigued, I did some homework to share with you. The childhood obesity-child protection issue has emerged over the past several years, garnering increased media and professional attention. At the 2007 British Medical Associations annual meeting, members rejected a motion in which obesity occurring in kids under 12 constituted a reason to charge parents with neglect and removal of the child into protective custody. This action followed on the heels of a BBC survey of 50 pediatricians who noted that childhood obesity had been a factor in at least 20 child protection cases in 2006. The UK is not alone in its concerns, which are evident internationally, including US courts which have already been removing some obese children from parents considered neglectful. Heres an example from Missouri, where an boy was removed from his foster home because his foster father was obese. The BMJ authors examined the existing literature on childhood obesity and protective actions and suggested a blueprint for action. What they found is that there is indeed evidence of an association between obesity and sexual abuse, violence and neglect. However, there is no data on the relationship between child protection actions and weight control in the long term. Moreover, theres no information about the long-term physical and mental welfare of an obese child who undergoes removal from the home and placement into foster care. The BMJ authors note that obesity is part of a larger constellation of child welfare concerns related to child protection. This means that all aspects of the childs family and living environment, including nutrition and activity, need to be closely assessed when determining whats best for the childs welfare. To further complicate things, there is good research that shows even when obese children have strong family support or ready access to credible weight-loss programs, kids can still struggle to remove the pounds. They suggest that failure to comply with obesity treatment (missing appointments, not supporting obese children with weight management programs or even actively sabotaging their kids\\' efforts) is tantamount to neglect, especially in those kids who are already suffering medical consequences arising from their obesity. In reviewing the media coverage on this topic, its clear that the Brits are more open to aggressive legal actions, especially for children under 12. They see it as an issue of extreme overfeeding, which, they believe, constitutes abuse. They argue that malnutrition and starvation of a child results in immediate court interventions, so why not obesity? But the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health has continued to argue that obesity is a public health problem, not a child protection issue.... The bottom line is that this is a very complex and controversial issue. The real goal is to protect children from serious harm. Most pediatricians have gone on record noting that the majority of parents do care about their children, but may not be knowledgeable about how to do it. That means that every parent must be a role model for their children by walking the talk and creating a healthy living environment for the whole family. Doctors and all medical care providers are also role models and mentors who need to provide counseling, education and programs for parents to help obese children and their families.

The answer involves how much intra-abdominal and liver fat you have. The scientists performed MRI scans on 243 (99 men, mean age 47 years, and 144 women, mean age 44 years) before and after nine months of a healthy lifestyle-intervention program, with a goal of shedding 5 percent of original body weight. The participants reduced their fat intake to no more than 30 percent of total calories, and walked at least three hours per week while generally engaging in moderate physical activity each day. All of the study subjects were considered at risk for developing type 2 diabetes. They had a BMI of 27 or greater, impaired glucose tolerance and\/or a first-degree relative with type 2 diabetes. In addition to the MRI scans, researchers also measured insulin sensitivity, since people who have type 2 diabetes dont respond appropriately to insulin (a hormone secreted by the pancreas that is crucial to glucose metabolism). After nine months in the healthier lifestyle program, scientists found that: * 71% of the men and 58% of the women experienced improved insulin sensitivity, and along with this they shed lots of intra-abdominal fat (19% reduced in women, 20% in men), and liver fat (35% reduced in women, 44% in men), while the overall body weight decreased by 3-5%. * The study subjects who fared the best with shedding fat started out with lower baseline levels of intra-abdominal and liver fat. * Participants who did not experience an improvement in insulin sensitivity dropped much smaller amounts of intra-abdominal fat (4% reduced in women, 6% in men), while men shed 15% of their liver fat and women actually gained 22% more liver fat. Here are some take-home messages to help guide you on your quest to live your best healthy lifestyle: 1. Its not just how fat you are, but its where the fat is at that counts. Fat that is carried primarily on the lower half of the body (hips, thighs, buttocks), is metabolically different than intra-abdominal and liver fat. Excessive inner belly fat is highly associated with a higher risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes and some cancers. It is also associated with an increased level of inflammation, which is often a precursor to these medical conditions. 2. Mind your middle. Grab a tape measure right now and whip it around your tummy across your belly button. Your goal is to keep your waist size under 35\" for women, and below 40\" if youre a guy. Want to know if youve got too much inner belly fat? First, look in the mirror. If youre more apple shaped (versus pear shape), you may have too much intra-abdominal fat. Second, lay down on your back on a flat surface. Intra-abdominal fat doesnt move since its wedged underneath your abdominal muscle. Simply look down and if your belly is protruding like youre pregnant (this includes you guys), then you have excessive inner belly fat. If you have a normal amount of inner belly fat, you should be pretty flat across your pelvic bones. 3. Practice girth control. Clearly, the best way to manage your intra-abdominal fat is to prevent weight gain in the first place. It becomes much easier to pack on the pounds inside your abdomen after the age of 40. If youve already accumulated fat inside your abdomen, heres how to get rid of it: * Consistent, intense exercise: Combine daily 30 or more minutes accrued of aerobic activity with intervals of intensity, along with weight lifting 2 x week. You need both. The aerobic activity with intensity intervals will prompt intra-abdominal fat cells to release their fat fuel and decrease the fat load. The weight lifting increases your ability to burn calories faster and more efficiently. * Strategic nutrition: Most Americans consume between 400-600 grams of carbs daily, mostly processed junk. Try to limit your carbs to no more than about 200 grams per day. Eliminate junk carbs (processed foods, white carbs  white bread, pasta, rice, potato) and prioritize whole foods such as veggies, watery fruits and whole grains, along with lean protein sources. Control your portions, keeping your total daily caloric intake appropriate for either weight reduction or maintenance. 4. People are different. This study does underscore the fact that people are indeed very different. We have unique family histories, medical experiences, body shapes and fat distributions.

Dont skip meals, especially breakfast. End your eating with dinner, preferably by 8PM. Eat smaller, balanced meals and snacks. Get Rid of Refined Sugars. Refined or processed sugars will sabotage your best efforts to rein in runaway appetites. Get them out of your house and any space you live and work in. Stick with whole foods fruits, veggies, grains and lean protein. Vacuum in the Veggies. You can eat endless portions of non-starchy veggies. Theyll fill you up and not out. Eat them throughout the day. Add them to brown rice, as a side with beans, and in soups. There are countless way to incorporate these life giving plants into your daily meals and snacks. Try This Trick to Feel Full. Throughout the day, combine lean protein with fiber. It takes the body much longer to digest carrots and hummus, or chicken and veggies, or peanut butter on an apple. Youll feel full, your appetite will be controlled and you can carry on with your days activities. Shake It Up. Try a protein shake for a meal or a mid-afternoon snack. One scoop or whey or soy protein powder delivers about 20 grams of protein (equivalent to a chicken breast). Add water, or skim milk, or plain yogurt along with fresh or frozen fruit and sip. Its a simple and easy way to stay satisfied and well nourished. Cut Out the Nocturnal Feasting. Too many calories consumed at night equal lots of extra body fat. Top that with eating too much too late and youve got bulging bellies and sagging saddlebags popping up everywhere. Make a commitment that during the work week, youll cut off your eating by 8PM (If you eat after 8 youll gain a lot of weight), or earlier. You can play a little later on Friday and Saturday, but dont go whole hog. Get to bed earlier as well. You cant overeat and sleep at the same time.

The big question is how long you will keep that weight off. Because food was often scarce for our ancestors, our bodies have been genetically programmed to combat the effects of fasting. When you eat less food, your metabolism slows down to conserve energy. Then, when you go back to your usual diet, your lowered metabolism may cause you to store more energy, meaning that you will probably gain back the weight you lost and possibly even put on more weight when eating the same calories you did before the fast. As you fast, your body will adjust by reducing your appetite, so you will initially feel less hungry. But once you have stopped fasting, your appetite hormones will kick back into gear and you may actually feel hungrier and be more likely to binge. Research has shown that fasting on alternate days can help people lose weight, but not for long. In one study, people who followed an alternate-day fasting diet shed weight, even when they ate all they wanted on the non-fasting days. However, they could not maintain the weight loss over time.

Today, the pendulum of medical opinion has swung away from both notions. While arousal takes longer as a man ages, chronic erectile dysfunction warrants medical attention. Moreover, the difficulty is often not psychological in origin. Today, urologists believe that physical factors underlie perhaps 90% of cases of persistent erectile dysfunction in men over age 50. Erectile dysfunction in older men. Because erections primarily involve the blood vessels, it is not surprising that the most common causes in older men are conditions that block blood flow to the penis, such as atherosclerosis or diabetes. Another vascular cause may be a faulty vein, which lets blood drain too quickly from the penis. Other physical disorders, as well as hormonal imbalances and certain operations, may also result in erectile dysfunction. The vascular processes that produce an erection are controlled by the nervous system, and certain prescription medications may have the side effect of interfering with necessary nerve signals. Among the possible culprits are a variety of stimulants, sedatives, diuretics, antihistamines, and agents to treat high blood pressure, cancer, or depression. In addition, alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drugs, such as marijuana, may contribute to the dysfunction. Erectile dysfunction in younger men. With younger men, psychological problems are the likeliest reason for erectile dysfunction.

It can also cause partners of men with ED to question their own sexual desirability. There are drugs that specifically address ED, and finding a solution can be as simple as taking a pill your doctor prescribes. But even if your erection problem can\\'t be resolved with oral medication, there are other options that your doctor can help you explore, including injections, suppositories, surgery and penile implants, and special devices like a vacuum pump that increases the flow of blood into the penis.

Or maybe your doctor has found a lump in your side during a routine exam or a sign of kidney cancer during a test for another disease. Regardless, to confirm a diagnosis of kidney cancer, you will need a thorough physical exam, health history, and tests. Your doctor will feel your abdomen and side for lumps and check for fever and high blood pressure, among other things. You will also answer questions about your health habits, any past illnesses, and types of treatment. To make a diagnosis of kidney cancer, your doctor will also order one or more tests like these: Urine tests check for blood in your urine or other signs of problems. Blood tests show how well your kidneys are working. Intravenous pyelogram (IVP) involves X-raying your kidneys after the doctor injects a dye that travels to your urinary tract, highlighting any tumors. Ultrasound uses sound waves to create a picture of your kidneys. It can help tell if a tumor is solid or fluid-filled. A CT scan uses X-rays and a computer to create a series of detailed pictures of your kidneys. This may also require an injection of dye. CT scans have virtually replaced pyelogram and ultrasound as a tool for diagnosing kidney cancer. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses strong magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of soft tissues in your body. You may need an injection of a contrast agent to create better pictures. Renal arteriogram. This test is used to evaluate the blood supply to the tumor. It is not given often but may help diagnose small tumors and has other uses as well. Unlike with many other cancers, your doctor may be pretty certain about a diagnosis of kidney cancer without a biopsy. In rare cases, it may be done to confirm the diagnosis. A doctor may use a needle biopsy to remove a sample of tissue, which is then examined under a microscope for cancer cells. The biopsy may also tell the grade of the cancer -- how aggressive the cancer is likely to be. Often, the surgeon will simply remove the entire tumor and then have a sample of tissue examined. Once your doctor makes a diagnosis of kidney cancer, you may need other tests to tell if the cancer has spread within your kidney, to the other kidney, or to other parts of your body. When cancer spreads from the place where it first started, it has metastasized. You might need a CT scan or MRI. A chest X-ray can show whether the cancer has spread to your lungs. A bone scan can see if it is in your bones. PET scans are helpful in telling if cancer has spread to lymph nodes near the kidney. These tests will help your doctor know the stage of kidney cancer.

When body tissues are inflamed, the disease is active. When tissue inflammation subsides, the disease is inactive (in remission). Remissions can occur spontaneously or with treatment and can last weeks, months, or years. During remissions, symptoms of the disease disappear, and people generally feel well. When the disease becomes active again (relapse), symptoms return. The return of disease activity and symptoms is called a flare. The course of rheumatoid arthritis varies among affected individuals, and periods of flares and remissions are typical. When the disease is active, symptoms can include fatigue, loss of energy, lack of appetite, low-grade fever, muscle and joint aches, and stiffness. Muscle and joint stiffness are usually most notable in the morning and after periods of inactivity. Arthritis is common during disease flares. Also during flares, joints frequently become red, swollen, painful, and tender. This occurs because the lining tissue of the joint (synovium) becomes inflamed, resulting in the production of excessive joint fluid (synovial fluid). The synovium also thickens with inflammation (synovitis). Rheumatoid arthritis usually inflames multiple joints in a symmetrical pattern (both sides of the body affected). Early symptoms may be subtle. The small joints of both the hands and wrists are often involved. Symptoms in the hands with rheumatoid arthritis include difficulty with simple tasks of daily living, such as turning door knobs and opening jars. The small joints of the feet are also commonly involved, which can lead to painful walking, especially in the morning after arising from bed. Occasionally, only one joint is inflamed. When only one joint is involved, the arthritis can mimic the joint inflammation caused by other forms of arthritis, such as gout or joint infection. Chronic inflammation can cause damage to body tissues, including cartilage and bone. This leads to a loss of cartilage and erosion and weakness of the bones as well as the muscles, resulting in joint deformity, destruction, and loss of function. Rarely, rheumatoid arthritis can even affect the joint that is responsible for the tightening of our vocal cords to change the tone of our voice, the cricoarytenoid joint. When this joint is inflamed, it can cause hoarseness of the voice. Joint symptoms in children with rheumatoid arthritis include limping, irritability, crying, and poor appetite. Since rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic disease, its inflammation can affect organs and areas of the body other than the joints. Inflammation of the glands of the eyes and mouth can cause dryness of these areas and is referred to as Sjogren\\'s syndrome. Dryness of the eyes can lead to corneal abrasion. Inflammation of the white parts of the eyes (the sclerae) is referred to as scleritis and can be very dangerous to the eye. Rheumatoid inflammation of the lung lining (pleuritis) causes chest pain with deep breathing, shortness of breath, or coughing. The lung tissue itself can also become inflamed, scarred, and sometimes nodules of inflammation (rheumatoid nodules) develop within the lungs. Inflammation of the tissue (pericardium) surrounding the heart, called pericarditis, can cause a chest pain that typically changes in intensity when lying down or leaning forward. The rheumatoid disease can reduce the number of red blood cells (anemia) and white blood cells. Decreased white cells can be associated with an enlarged spleen (referred to as Felty\\'s syndrome) and can increase the risk of infections. Firm lumps under the skin (rheumatoid nodules) can occur around the elbows and fingers where there is frequent pressure. Even though these nodules usually do not cause symptoms, occasionally they can become infected. Nerves can become pinched in the wrists to cause carpal tunnel syndrome. A rare, serious complication, usually with long-standing rheumatoid disease, is blood vessel inflammation (vasculitis). Vasculitis can impair blood supply to tissues and lead to tissue death (necrosis). This is most often initially visible as tiny black areas around the nail beds or as leg ulcers.

Instead, rheumatoid arthritis is diagnosed based on a combination of the presentation of the joints involved, characteristic joint stiffness in the morning, the presence of blood rheumatoid factor and citrulline antibody, as well as findings of rheumatoid nodules and radiographic changes (X-ray testing). The first step in the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis is a meeting between the doctor and the patient. The doctor reviews the history of symptoms, examines the joints for inflammation, tenderness, swelling, and deformity, the skin for rheumatoid nodules (firm bumps under the skin, most commonly over the elbows or fingers), and other parts of the body for inflammation. Certain blood and X-ray tests are often obtained. The diagnosis will be based on the pattern of symptoms, the distribution of the inflamed joints, and the blood and X-ray findings. Several visits may be necessary before the doctor can be certain of the diagnosis. A doctor with special training in arthritis and related diseases is called a rheumatologist. The distribution of joint inflammation is important to the doctor in making a diagnosis. In rheumatoid arthritis, the small joints of the hands, wrists, feet, and knees are typically inflamed in a symmetrical distribution (affecting both sides of the body). When only one or two joints are inflamed, the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis becomes more difficult. The doctor may then perform other tests to exclude arthritis due to infection or gout. The detection of rheumatoid nodules (described above), most often around the elbows and fingers, can suggest the diagnosis. Abnormal antibodies can be found in the blood of people with rheumatoid arthritis. An antibody called \"rheumatoid factor\" can be found in 80% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Patients who are felt to have rheumatoid arthritis and do not have positive rheumatoid factor testing are referred as having \"seronegative rheumatoid arthritis.\" Citrulline antibody (also referred to as anticitrulline antibody, anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibody, and anti-CCP) is present in most people with rheumatoid arthritis. It is useful in the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis when evaluating cases of unexplained joint inflammation. Another antibody called the \"antinuclear antibody\" (ANA) is also frequently found in people with rheumatoid arthritis. A blood test called the sedimentation rate (sed rate) is a measure of how fast red blood cells fall to the bottom of a test tube. The sed rate is used as a crude measure of the inflammation of the joints. The sed rate is usually faster during disease flares and slower during remissions. Another blood test that is used to measure the degree of inflammation present in the body is the C-reactive protein. Joint X-rays may be normal or only show swelling of soft tissues early in the disease. As the disease progresses, X-rays can show bony erosions typical of rheumatoid arthritis in the joints. Joint X-rays can also be helpful in monitoring the progression of disease and joint damage over time. Bone scanning, a procedure using a small amount of a radioactive substance, can also be used to demonstrate the inflamed joints. MRI scanning can also be used to demonstrate joint damage. The American College of Rheumatology has developed a system for classifying rheumatoid arthritis that is primarily based upon the X-ray appearance of the joints. This system helps medical professionals classify the severity of your rheumatoid arthritis with respect to cartilage, ligaments, and bone. Stage I no damage seen on X-rays, although there may be signs of bone thinning Stage II on X-ray, evidence of bone thinning around a joint with or without slight bone damage slight cartilage damage possible joint mobility may be limited; no joint deformities observed atrophy of adjacent muscle abnormalities of soft tissue around joint possible Stage III on X-ray, evidence of cartilage and bone damage and bone thinning around the joint joint deformity without permanent stiffening or fixation of the joint extensive muscle atrophy abnormalities of soft tissue around joint possible Stage IV on X-ray, evidence of cartilage and bone damage and osteoporosis around joint joint deformity with permanent fixation of the joint (referred to as ankylosis) extensive muscle atrophy abnormalities of soft tissue around joint possible ","votes":"190","membertype":"Expert","helpful":"180","title":"How is rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed?","url":"http:\/\/answers.webmd.com\/answers\/1173595\/how-is-rheumatoid-arthritis-diagnosed","membername":"\"Carolyn O'Neil","membervotes":"0"},{"descr":"","questionId":"1173597","followers":"0","ans":"I have had Rheumatoid Arthritis since I was 17, it is not fun at all.

People can transmit EBV to other people for six months or longer after recovering from mononucleosis. In studies, many people continue to have EBV in their saliva for up to 18 months after symptoms of mono have resolved. Thats why most people who get mononucleosis dont remember being around (or kissing) someone with mono. Its also possible to periodically shed EBV virus in ones saliva throughout life, without having symptoms. Its not clear if people commonly transmit the virus during these periods. Fever, sore throat, fatigue, and swollen tonsils and lymph nodes are the usual symptoms of mono. The worst of the symptoms go away in one to two weeks, but fatigue can last for months. Vetsika, EK.

If you just have an occasional bout of heartburn, for instance, you ate a spicy meal, then you can use a regular antacid, a Maalox or a Mylanta product. You want to make sure though that you shake it really well; a lot of people forget about that. Also too, if you are taking medications, you may need to space it; either take it an hour before you take your medications or two hours afterwards, because it can actually bind to the medicine and therefore the medicine won\\'t work as well. If you notice though that you have like two days in a row where you have had consistent heartburn, then you may want to try a H2 blocker. Pepcid is one consideration. Zantac. You want to talk to your pharmacist though and let us know if you are taking any other medications. Zantac has a tendency to interact with other medicines. So if you have your medication list handy, we can take a look at it, and make sure there is no potential for drug interactions. If it\\'s two or more episodes a week that you are experiencing heartburn, then you are going to want to go towards the proton pump inhibitor, and Prilosec OTC is an example of that. You want to use it for 14 days, but once again, you want to talk to your pharmacist to make sure that you are not taking any other medicines, or possibly taking any duplicate medicines that could do the same thing. Then also, if you are not feeling well after the 14 days, a pharmacist is probably going to refer you back to your doctor or healthcare provider, because it probably needs a little bit more evaluation.

Estimates show that as many of 25% of children diagnosed with ADD or ADHD may actually have an underlying sleep problem that can be treated  resulting in better behavior and improved learning skills. Most often a sleep problem is identified in children and then health providers, researchers and parents look for behavior issues. A new study at the University of Michigan approached children, behavior and their sleep with a new twist: the study first looked for children with certain behaviors, and then looked at the sleep patterns of those children. The cross sectional survey at the University of Michigan showed some very intriguing results: kids who show aggressive behavior in school are twice as likely to have symptoms of sleep disordered breathing as children that do not exhibit aggressive behaviors. Of the 341 students surveyed by the researchers, about 32% were assessed by their parent or teacher as having a conduct problem via a standardized behavior questionnaire. Parents of these children also completed a standardized pediatric sleep questionnaire, and scores for identification of symptoms for sleep disordered breathing (snoring, stopping breathing, daytime sleepiness, etc.) were collected. So aggressive kids appear to be sleepy kids, and it is not always because they are snoring (which might make you think they are not getting good quality sleep). What could be the culprits?

Let\\'s look at what I consider the biggest reason that UTI\\'s go undiagnosed in the elderly. Delays in diagnosing a UTI - Recognizing a UTI in the elderly is not always distinguished as the cause for their newly acquired behavioral problems. The elderly may be seen in a soiled condition and it may be assumed that the individual is incontinent. In frequent cases, this conjecture is not factually based. Typically tell-tale signs of a UTI such as burning, changes in urine color, the need to void frequently, possible blood in the urine, fever and a need to urinate urgently are missing ingredients from the picture with an elderly person. Instead, and totally unintended by staff and family members, focus is generated towards the patient\\'s emotional decline and the UTI is overlooked as the basic cause of their negative behavior. Another reason for the diagnostic delay is that weve been conditioned, by way of urinary tract infections occurring in younger groups, to be associated with frequent sexual activety accompanied with multiple partners. Here are some suggestive actions : The sooner that a UTI is diagnosed, the sooner that anti-biotic treatment can be started and medical resolution can occur. Along with that medical resolution may become a happier person who is not soiled, not in pain from a UTI, and whose mental behavior takes positive spike upwards.

But there are a few cases. You don\\'t want to give aspirin or Motrin or Advil to a child up to the age of 15. There is a syndrome called Reye\\'s Syndrome, which could happen if your child has influenza or the chickenpox, and because it\\'s a virus, the aspirin actually triggers an effect that could cause some severe learning disorders, disabilities in the long run. So there was a big, I think, call to action about this, about 10 or 15 years ago. And then Advil and Motrin kind of weren\\'t available over-the-counter; well, now they are back. So you want to be careful as a parent, if your physician advises you to give these products, make sure you give the dose that your physician or healthcare provider advised, and only in situations where they know about it. Tylenol is really the drug of choice to be used in that situation. If you are an elderly person as well, usually they are on a lot of prescription medications, including blood thinners, and you should not be on a blood thinner plus aspirin. It could actually make your blood too thin, and you are going to run into some problems with internal bleeding, or in men, if you shave and you nick yourself, you may not be able to stop the bleeding. So you want to be really careful about that. Make sure you are going for your blood work and tell your physician or healthcare provider anything that you are taking that might contain aspirin. As a pharmacist as well, use one pharmacy. Make sure you have your medication list, because a lot of people will come in and say, oh, I am looking for something for pain, and I want just an aspirin product.

You too, probably. But learning about these little guys makes it a bit easier to tolerate when your child comes home with them someday! What are lice? The human louse feeds on our hair. And, they travel from one head to the next by crawling. No, they dont fly (they are wingless). And lice really like it if you share combs, hairbrushes or hats with another person  that way they can be easily transported to a new home on someone elses head. Are lice a sign of poor hygiene? Head lice do not care whether you are rich or poor, have stellar hygiene or bathe once a week. They are equal opportunity creatures. Dont be embarrassed if your child gets an infestation. Grossed out, yes. Embarrassed, no. How do I look for head lice in my child? Adult lice are brown and large enough to be seen but they move very quickly. So, its much more common to diagnose head lice by finding their white eggshells (called nits). The nits stick firmly to the hair shaft close to the scalp. (Unlike dandruff, that easily brushes out or moves when you shake your head.) Youll find them mostly behind the ears and the back of the neck. Start looking if your child is suddenly scratching his head for no other good reason (theyre pretty itchy!). How are lice treated? 1. Start with tried and true over-the-counter remedies like Rid or Nix (1% permethrin or pyrethrin). Do one treatment, and then repeat seven to 10 days later. 2. Dont obsess about cleaning the entire house! 3. Any items that are used in the hair (brushes, combs, hair clips) can be placed in an airtight plastic bag for four weeks and then they are ready for use again. 4. The problem: lice are becoming increasingly resilient and resistant to treatment. Other options include: prescription Ulesfia (benzyl alcohol) wash or Ovide (malathion). Some doctors also prescribe a higher potency permethrin product called Elimite. There are also other over-the-counter options. Tea tree oil and Cetaphil lotion may also treat head lice, but the evidence that they work is more anecdotal than scientifically proven. Does my child need to stay home until the lice are treated? No. Kids often get sent home from school when lice are detected. However, this week the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) reiterated their position on this outdated strategy: kids should not be excused from school due to head lice. Lice are an infestation, and they have usually been alive and well on a childs head for at least four weeks before the itchiness occurs and diagnosis is made. And they do not spread when children are sitting at their desks and learning. So, kindly ask your school to check out the AAPs website if they have any concerns.

Drug addiction is a brain disease because the abuse of drugs leads to changes in the structure and function of the brain. Although it is true that for most people the initial decision to take drugs is voluntary, over time the changes in the brain caused by repeated drug abuse can affect a person\\'s self control and ability to make sound decisions, and at the same time send intense impulses to take drugs. It is because of these changes in the brain that it is so challenging for a person who is addicted to stop abusing drugs. Fortunately, there are treatments that help people to counteract addiction\\'s powerful disruptive effects and regain control. Research shows that combining addiction treatment medications, if available, with behavioral therapy is the best way to ensure success for most patients. Treatment approaches that are tailored to each patient\\'s drug abuse patterns and any co-occurring medical, psychiatric, and social problems can lead to sustained recovery and a life without drug abuse. Similar to other chronic, relapsing diseases, such as diabetes, asthma, or heart disease, drug addiction can be managed successfully. And, as with other chronic diseases, it is not uncommon for a person to relapse and begin abusing drugs again. Relapse, however, does not signal failure  rather, it indicates that treatment should be reinstated, adjusted, or that alternate treatment is needed to help the individual regain control and recover.

You can go out the elevator, go downstairs, in the elevator by yourself. You can do it. You can go to the ladies room, the mens room, wherever you want to do it. Its so easy.

We have noticed that more men will begin to drink alcohol excessively and that is probably because they want to be seen as strong and if they go to a doctor for any kind of help with this, it will mean that they are not men, so better to drink and try to drink your troubles away than to try and get some help. Women on the other hand, will say look, if Im this stressed, Ive got to go get some help. We know that more women enter therapy than man. That has always been as long as I can remember and theyve been keeping statistics, that women are willing to talk to others and to try to come to terms with how do I cope with this, how can I change this, what am I missing, they will talk about their problems. Men will talk about the baseball scores. They wont talk about their problems. Thats why the statistics are skewed probably that they say that women have more anxiety and depression than men. No, its because more women show up at the office and get counted and men dont get counted. If we went into bars and started doing some kind of research, I would wonder, before they took their first drink, how would they register on stress measures, on anxiety, depression measures, and I think we would find a rather dramatic shift.

But weird can mean several things in this regard. It can imply dreams that call up people from the past, the dead or even those of a sexual nature. Strange dreams can also entail those that wake us up in a state of high anxiety and stress. You know the kind: Youve shown up for a big test that you didnt study for, or an event in your real life goes horribly wrong in your dream life. The stressful dreams usually follow a similar pattern. And they are commonly experienced, ranging from those that have you losing your teeth to being chased or to coming close to dying. An article in an online British newspaper recently reported on a Chinese study done on the effects bad dreams can have on us. No, its not just about the disrupting, sweaty sleep they can cause. Bad dreams can actually have far more health consequences than you might imagine. Problems like: * Insomnia. * Fatigue. * Headaches. * Depression. * Anxiety. In fact, mental health problems, such as depression, were five times more common in people who had regular nightmares. And about one in 20 people suffer from frequent or chronic nightmares  defined as at least once a week. Technically, nightmares are defined as frightening dreams that awaken you from rapid eye movement or REM sleep, a time when there are high levels of brain activity. Interestingly, the study also showed that women were more susceptible to these dreams than men. Other findings of note: * Those in the neurotic category were more likely to have scary dreams. * There is evidence of a genetic susceptibility to nightmares. * Frequency was also linked to income and unemployment. Those reporting the lowest incomes were 2.3 times more likely to have three or more nightmares a week compared to the more affluent. * Higher levels of stress associated with lower incomes and social status may predispose some people to nightmares. * The risk of having a psychiatric disorder was 5.7 times greater for those with frequent nightmares compared with those without. So what were the top nightmares in the study? * Falling (39.5%). * Being chased (25.7%). * Being paralyzed (25.3%). * Being late for an event (24.0%). * Close person disappears\/ dies (20.9%). * Horror films (18.9%). * Unable to complete a task (17.3%). Which ones have you had? If youre the type who does experience frequent nightmares, dont fret that youre doomed to have a psychiatric disorder or on the road to depression. Thats not the point. The best solution to preventing bad dreams begins with better managing stress in your life. After all, living a low-stress life has enormous health benefits that will automatically reduce your risk for the very same conditions that nightmares seem to trigger, such as insomnia, depression and anxiety. You probably cant prevent every bad dream from creeping into your bedroom at night, but look at it another way: perhaps the bad dreams allow you to work through some of your emotional issues that are better left in the bedroom than in your real, waking life.

Breus","membervotes":"0"},{"descr":" PhD","questionId":"1190553","followers":"0","ans":"Nightmares can be defined as a frightening dream that will awaken an individual from REM sleep. Most people, when asked, will recall the content of the dream, and in some cases, even days after it occurred. If you ask people, almost everyone can recall having had a nightmare, but there are some unfortunate souls who have them with great regularity. I have had several patients come to me with stories of both nightmares and insomnia. These patients will often present in clinic with: * An inability to fall asleep. o This can often be due to fear of having a nightmare. * An inability to stay asleep. o This can occur when they are woken up in the middle of the night, from a nightmare and do not want to go back to sleep for fear that the nightmare will continue. * Restless sleep. o This is often the accumulation of both of the above situations. So what are some of the current nightmare treatments available? Unfortunately, this topic is one that does not have a tremendous amount of research available but here is what we have seen: Medication: medication has been shown to be both a cause and a treatment of nightmares. * In some cases, vivid dreams or nightmares have been reported side effects of certain medications. * While in other cases, certain anti-depressant medications (SSRIs and tricyclics) can reduce the frequency of nightmares by reducing the amount of REM sleep you are getting. Talk therapy: *Work has been done where the person having the nightmare will wake up and write down everything that they can remember about the dream. * In as much detail as they can, even with the potential horrible endings (people getting killed, loved ones getting hurt, or persecuted). * Next they collect these dreams over the course of a week or so and create a script as though it were a play or movie scene. * Finally they CHANGE THE ENDING so that whatever is the horrible consequence is changed so that they become the hero of the dream! * This new version of the dream is then read, by the person several times right before they go to bed, to influence their dreaming. So what can you do if you are having nightmares? * First, realize that this may be more common than you think. * Next, speak to your doctor about any medication you are taking and be sure to read the package inserts on any medication to see if vivid dreams or nightmares may be a side effect. * Consider that a drug interaction (two medications together, or a glass of wine before taking a medication) could be causing the effect. * Consider speaking to a psychiatrist or your general practitioner about a medication to help reduce nightmares by reducing your REM sleep. * Consider speaking to a therapist about how to begin the journaling process.

The inability to sleep at least 7-8 hours per night, along with experiencing frequent nightmares, are not sufficient symptoms by themselves to support the PTSD diagnosis. This is not to say that you are not afflicted with PTSD . Please consider seeing a professional in the field and allow them to test and question you thoroughly on possible other unreported symptoms.Some psychological testing is completed using what I call The Restaurant Like Menu Scoring System to rate your symptoms. For example in order to being classified as fitting the PTSD guidelines, you may have to experience 3 symptoms from column A, along with 2 conditions from column B, and at least 3 conditions from column C. There are also other types of testing. Some of examples of PSTD experiences may include a horrible event that threatened your life, your safety, or that of another. These acts may include crimes such as rape, robbery with a weapon, and many others. People in combat and discharged from the military are a group especially affected by PTSD. Other necessary ingredients to arrive at a diagnosis of PTSD may include the following and many others: Your response to these horrible acts should have resulted in intense fear or helplessness. As a PSTD victim, you continue to relive these horrible experiences through recurrent and persistent thoughts and dreams. You avoid discussion and other stimuli relating to the life threatening event. You experience sleep difficulties,have angry outbursts, and you may be hyper- vigilant (\"jumpy\"). As you can see, arriving at a diagnosis of PTSD is an art best left to the clinical experts. They probably will evaluate your entire physical as well as your emotional well being before arriving at any final conclusions. Your symptoms appear to be at a serious level and deserve immediate medical and psychological evaluation and possible treatment.

Often, this procedure can be performed in a physician\\'s office or in an emergency department with local anesthesia. After numbing the area with an injection of a local anesthetic, an incision with a scalpel is made over the infected area. The physician will then drain the pus and remove hair and any other debris from the wound. The wound is then packed with gauze and allowed to heal. Antibiotics are not necessary unless your physician feels that you have a spreading skin infection (cellulitis). For those individuals with recurrent or complicated pilonidal cysts, more invasive surgery may be necessary. Several different surgical techniques may be used in this case, and your surgeon will discuss the various options with you. In general, the major difference in surgical techniques involves either leaving the surgical wound open after surgery and allowing it to heal (requiring a longer healing time but having a lower recurrence rate) versus closing the surgical wound during surgery (with a shorter healing time but higher recurrence rate). Another surgical technique involves suturing the skin edges of the wound and allowing the open wound to slowly heal (marsupialization). Proper wound care and follow-up with a surgeon should be arranged after either of the above procedures. Keep the wound clean and remove any hair from around the site to prevent recurrence.

In acute renal failure, kidney function is lost rapidly and can occur from a variety of insults to the body. The list of causes is often categorized based on where the injury has occurred. Prerenal causes are due to decreased blood supply to the kidney. Examples of prerenal causes are: Hypovolemia (low blood volume) due to blood loss. Dehydration from loss of body fluid (vomiting, diarrhea, sweating, fever). Poor intake of fluids. Medication, for example, diuretics (water pills) may cause excessive water loss. Loss of blood supply to the kidney due to obstruction of the renal artery or vein. Renal causes (damage directly to the kidney itself) include: Sepsis: The body\\'s immune system is overwhelmed from infection and causes inflammation and shutdown of the kidneys. This usually does not occur with urinary tract infections. Medications: Some medications are toxic to the kidney, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen and naproxen. Others are antibiotics like aminoglycosides (gentamicin, tobramycin), lithium (Eskalith, Lithobid), iodine-containing medications such as those injected for radiology dye studies. Rhabdomyolysis: This is a situation in which there is significant muscle breakdown in the body, and the degeneration products of muscle fibers clog the filtering system of the kidneys. Often occurring because of trauma and crush injuries, it can also be caused by some medications used to treat high cholesterol. Multiple Myeloma. Acute glomerulonephritis or inflammation of the glomeruli, the filtering system of the kidneys. Many diseases can cause this inflammation including systemic lupus erythematosus, Wegener\\'s granulomatosis, and Goodpasture syndrome. Post-renal causes are due to factors that affect outflow of the urine: Obstruction of the bladder or the ureters can cause back pressure when there is no place for the urine to go as the kidneys continue to work. When the pressure increases enough, the kidneys shut down. Prostatic hypertrophy or prostate cancer may block the urethra and prevent the bladder from emptying. Tumors in the abdomen that surround and obstruct the ureters. Kidney stones. Chronic renal failure develops over months and years. The most common causes of chronic renal failure are related to: Poorly controlled diabetes. Poorly controlled high blood pressure. Chronic glomerulonephritis. Less common causes: Polycystic kidney disease. Reflux nephropathy. Kidney stones. Prostate disease.

Some women may experience few or no symptoms of menopause, while others experience multiple physical and psychological symptoms. The extent and severity of symptoms varies significantly among women. Irregular vaginal bleeding Irregular vaginal bleeding may occur during menopause. Some women have minimal problems with abnormal bleeding during perimenopause whereas others have unpredictable, excessive bleeding. Menstrual periods (menses) may occur more frequently (meaning the cycle shortens in duration), or they may get farther and farther apart (meaning the cycle lengthens in duration) before stopping. There is no \"normal\" pattern of bleeding during the perimenopause, and patterns vary from woman to woman. It is common for women in perimenopause to have a period after going for several months without one. There is also no set length of time it takes for a woman to complete the menopausal transition. It is important to remember that all women who develop irregular menses should be evaluated by her doctor to confirm that the irregular menses are due to perimenopause and not as a sign of another medical condition. Hot flashes & night sweats Hot flashes are common among women undergoing menopause. A hot flash is a feeling of warmth that spreads over the body and is often most pronounced in the head and chest. A hot flash is sometimes associated with flushing and is sometimes followed by perspiration. Hot flashes usually last from 30 seconds to several minutes. Although the exact cause of hot flashes is not fully understood, hot flashes are likely due to a combination of hormonal and biochemical fluctuations brought on by declining estrogen levels. There is currently no method to predict when hot flashes will begin and how long they will last. Hot flashes occur in up to 40% of regularly menstruating women in their forties, so they may begin before the menstrual irregularities characteristic of menopause even begin. About 80% of women will be finished having hot flashes after five years. Sometimes (in about 10% of women), hot flashes can last as long as 10 years. There is no way to predict when hot flashes will cease, though they tend to decrease in frequency over time. The average woman who has hot flashes will have them for about five years. Sometimes hot flashes are accompanied by night sweats (episodes of drenching sweats at nighttime). This may lead to awakening and difficulty falling asleep again, resulting in unrefreshing sleep and daytime tiredness. Vaginal symptoms Vaginal symptoms occur as a result of the lining tissues of the vagina becoming thinner, drier, and less elastic as estrogen levels fall. Symptoms may include vaginal dryness, itching, or irritation and\/or pain with sexual intercourse (dyspareunia). The vaginal changes also lead to an increased risk of vaginal infections. Urinary symptoms The lining of the urethra also undergoes changes similar to the tissues of the vagina, and becomes drier, thinner, and less elastic with declining estrogen levels. This can lead to an increased risk of urinary tract infection, feeling the need to urinate more frequently, or leakage of urine (urinary incontinence). The incontinence can result from a strong, sudden urge to urinate or may occur during straining when coughing, laughing, or lifting heavy objects. Emotional and cognitive symptoms Women in perimenopause often report a variety of thinking (cognitive) and\/or emotional symptoms, including fatigue, memory problems, irritability, and rapid changes in mood. It is difficult to precisely determine exactly which behavioral symptoms are due directly to the hormonal changes of menopause. Research in this area has been difficult for many reasons. Other physical changes Many women report some degree of weight gain along with menopause. The distribution of body fat may change, with body fat being deposited more in the waist and abdominal area than in the hips and thighs. Changes in skin texture, including wrinkles, may develop along with worsening of adult acne in those affected by this condition.

The first reaction is often panic followed by a tidal wave of emotions: How can this be? Why me? Im scared and not able to handle this. But handle it you must. The following is a list of essential things that anyone newly diagnosed with cancer should know. 1. Understand the diagnosis. There are many different types of cancer, even within the same broad category. For example, breast cancer has three general categories: hormone receptor positive (for the estrogen and\/or progesterone receptors), Her2 positive, and triple negative (hormone receptors and Her2 are negative or not present); the three types are often treated very differently. Nearly every type of cancer has different sub-types and it is important to know which one you have. 2. Do not jump the gun and think the worst. Not all cancers of the same type act the same. Some bad cancers may be curable. Get all the facts straight and get them only from the experts who treat the disease, not from physicians who are not cancer experts and not from well-meaning friends and family who know someone with 3. Meet first with local specialists. What other tests are needed to fully determine the stage or extent of the cancer in the body? Do you need surgery, chemotherapy and\/or radiation? Have these questions answered first in your community, near where you live or work. Physicians that specialize in treating cancer have been highly trained whether they practice in a community setting or at a large medical center. Since cancer treatment may not be a one shot deal but can involve six months or more of therapy, it is important to make these treatments as convenient and safe as possible. Having a good cancer center close to home can make a world of difference. 4. Consider a second opinion. The need for a second opinion depends on the quality of the first opinions you receive and on your preferences as a patient. Do not think that the grass is greener elsewhere and that an incurable cancer is curable at a more heavily advertised center. If the cancer specialists in your area have an excellent reputation and you like their approach to you and your cancer, then you may not feel that another opinion is necessary. On the other hand, if you feel that surgery is better performed at a high volume center, for example, or you just want the peace of mind that comes with confirmation of treatment recommendations, then a second opinion is right for you. The best doctors do not dissuade patients from seeking other opinions nor from receiving cancer care close to home when that is more convenient.

Although there is only one person going under the surgical knife or receiving chemotherapy, cancer still affects an entire family and more. Seek the help of professional counselors who will help you cope with cancer as well as provide guidance on how to communicate effectively with your loved ones about your situation. Family and friends will want to help you cope with cancer but they will need guidance on how best to do so. Let them help you with chores, children and transportation to and from treatment. The diagnosis and treatment of cancer, no matter how successful the result, frequently causes depression and anxiety and nearly always, uncertainty. Learning how best to cope with these is vitally important to getting through the treatment phase and especially, during long-term survivorship. You and your employer will want to know how much time you will need to deal with cancer. Do not try to maintain a full work schedule during arduous treatments. Consider short or long-term disability depending on the rigors and after-effects of treatment. Even if you are highly likely to survive your cancer, the diagnosis is a good reason to get your financial situation in order, for the sake of you and your loved ones.

I love that this is the time of year for one of the most powerful antioxidants we can eat. The great news for us is that in November and December most grocery stores carry fresh (and organic) cranberries. The age-old jelly-out-of-a-can that is traditionally served at Thanksgiving does not hold a candle to the different varieties of things you can do with fresh ingredients. Whole cranberries are extremely tart, so you will need to sweeten them. I usually use agave nectar but you can use brown sugar, honey, or regular sugar depending on the amount. In the morning, you can add some frozen or fresh whole berries into a smoothie for a tart and unusual flavor (blend with strawberry, blueberries, or raspberries). These berries are also excellent to add to a high-fiber muffin. ... Take the fresh cranberries into lunch and dinner by using as a spread on a turkey sandwich or served with grilled chicken. A simple cooked sauce made with juice and zest of an orange, agave nectar, and cranberries can be chilled and served with brie cheese for an appetizer. Another great use for fresh cranberries is baked in a dessert with apples or pears. The combination of color, texture, and taste is fantastic. Again, you may have to add a tablespoon of extra agave or sugar to balance out the tartness of the cranberry. One of my favorite and more unusual recipes made with fresh cranberries is my cranberry, balsamic, and mint relish. This takes only minutes to make. In your food processor, you put fresh cranberries, orange zest, brown sugar, fresh ginger, mint and balsamic vinegar, pulse it, and store for up to one week. This mix is great on your holiday buffet for turkey but it is also a surprisingly delicious mix for a holiday martini. ... So the next time you are at the store, take a walk through the produce aisle for a few extra seconds and pick yourself up this antioxidant treat!

Below are some web sites to visit if you or someone you love is looking for Medicare information. Medicare Resources The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , which administers the Medicare program, offers mounds of information on its website. AARP recently announced the launch of its Medicare Summary Notice (MSN) Tool , which helps people make sense of confusing quarterly statements sent to Medicare recipients. MSNs contain a list of all the services or medical supplies billed to your Medicare account, and can be used to track the care you received, monitor out-of-pocket costs and even help you spot billing errors. The federal government\\'s Medicare.gov offers a wealth of information and resources for finding Medicare drug and health plans, Medigap policies (which help pay for care Medicare does not), doctors, hospitals and more. On the Medicare Plan Finder tool you can search for and compare benefits and costs of private insurance plans in your area (also known as Medicare Advantage plans). If you need help paying for your prescription medications, check to see if your state has a State Pharmaceutical Assistance Program . State Health Insurance Assistance Programs (SHIPS) provide Medicare recipients throughout the country with free access to counselors who offer personalized advice. To find the SHIP near you, visit the Medicare Helpful Contacts page on Medicare.gov or call 800- MEDICARE (800-633-4227). On this web page, you\\'ll also find links to other helpful resources. Mymedicalmatters.org , a website run by the National Council on Aging , has a lot of information about Medicare drug plans, how to evaluate your needs and how to sign up or switch your existing coverage. The Council also offers a benefits checkup tool where you can find and enroll in federal, state, local and private programs that help pay for prescription drugs, utility bills, meals, health care and other needs. The Center for Medicare Advocacy is a nonprofit, nonpartisan education and advocacy organization that has a wealth of information on its website about the various parts of Medicare as well as associated costs.

Causes of bony encroachment of the spinal nerves include foramen narrowing (narrowing of the portal through which the spinal nerve passes from the spinal column, out of the spinal canal to the body), spondylolisthesis (slipping of one vertebra relative to another), and spinal stenosis (narrowing of the spinal canal caused by compression of the nerve roots or spinal cord by bony spurs or other soft tissues in the spinal canal). For example, lumbar spinal nerve compression in these conditions can lead to sciatica pain that radiates down the lower extremities. Spinal stenosis (narrowing of the spinal canal) can occur at any level of the spine, but it\\'s most common in the lumbar spine of the low back. Symptoms depend on the level affected. For example, lumbar spinal stenosis can cause lower-extremity pains which worsen with walking and are relieved by resting (mimicking poor circulation of the lower extremities).

Here are the problems that may be expected: According to the Spinal Stenosis Authority , problems associated with spinal stenosis (narrowing of the spinal vertebrae) as we advance in age may be observed on diagnostic image testing, but not noted by the patient in the form of symptoms until the condition becomes well advanced. Those symptoms are usually a result of degenerative arthritic changes and a person may experience either tingling, numbness, pain, and weakness of a leg, hand, or foot. Symptoms seen in spinal stenosis typically develop over many years and have as their foundation some of the following anatomical changes: Elderly herniated discs- herniated discs in and by themselves may cause spinal stenosis; Elderly spondylolysis- The drifting of spinal column bones may contribute to spinal column narrowing; Elderly scoliosis- Abnormal spinal column curvatures can lead to spinal stenosis. Summary: Spinal stenosis is associated with degenerative arthritic changes that may be asymptomatic in a person until they reach the age of 60 years or older.

This time its salmonella enteriditis, which appears to be able to infect the ovaries of chickens, and can cause their eggs (usually the egg white) to be contaminated from the inside out. The eggs in question have been traced to a couple of high-volume egg producers in Iowa. But this outbreak aside, keep in mind that there are over 140,000 egg-related salmonella illnesses each year in the U.S., according to FDA estimates. Most salmonella cases dont require a doctor visit and can resolve in one to three days, according to the FDA, but its the 1 percent of cases that are severe, require hospitalization and are cause for great concern. I dont know about you, but I dont even want to experience the one to three-day salmonella poisoning. There is some hope that there will be a lower risk of salmonella from eggs in the future. New FDA regulations, which went into effect in July this year, are expected to cut the number of salmonella-carrying eggs by 60 percent. Egg-laying hens are thought to get salmonella from a couple different ways and it aint pretty thats for sure  through germs carried by flies and from eating the excrement of rodents that get into their feed. I personally am not afraid to use and enjoy eggs in my recipes and meals. I just automatically cook my eggs completely. I also use half eggs and half pasteurized egg substitute or egg white when making egg-based entrees, to bring down the saturated fat and cholesterol. And I try to purchase cage-free eggs (even better when they are cage-free and higher omega-3) for a variety of reasons. What else can you do? * Use the eggs you buy within four weeks. * Keep eggs refrigerated at least to 45F at all times. Store eggs in their carton in the center of the refrigerator instead of removing them and storing them in the door, which may not be cold enough. * To substantially reduce the risk of salmonella, do not eat raw eggs and cook your eggs and egg dishes completely (the white and yolk will be firm.) * Wash your hands, cooking utensils and food prep surfaces thoroughly after being in contact with eggshells and raw eggs. * Dont eat recalled eggs or products containing recalled eggs. * Discard cracked or dirty eggs. * Dont keep eggs warm or at room temperature for more than two hours. * Refrigerate unused or leftover egg-containing foods as soon as possible.

The results, reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed that after two weeks, 64 of the 92 (70%) patients in the bed-rest group reported improvement, as compared with 59 of the 91 (65%) of the patients in the control (watchful-waiting) group. After 12 weeks, 87% of the patients in both groups reported improvement. The results of assessments of the intensity of pain, the aggravation of symptoms, and functional status revealed no significant differences between the two groups. The extent of absenteeism from work and rates of surgical intervention were similar in the two groups. The researchers concluded that \"among patients with symptoms and signs of a lumbosacral radicular syndrome, bed rest is not a more effective therapy than watchful waiting.\" Sometimes, conventional wisdom is not as wise as research! Other treatment options for sciatica include addressing the underlying cause, medications to relieve pain and inflammation and relax muscles, and physical therapy.

Acne is caused by hormones; specifically the male hormones called androgens. The worst cases of acne are usually experienced during puberty, a time when hormones are fluctuating wildly. One would think that as you age you would no longer have issues with acne. However, women are especially prone to adult hormonal acne because your androgen levels fluctuate with your monthly cycle. Other women have serious problems with androgens and suffer from a condition called polycystic ovarian syndrome. The women who suffer from adult hormonal acne have breakouts mainly around their chin and lips. This form of acne typically beings after age 25 and can plague a women throughout the course of her life. This becomes even worse as she becomes peri-menopausal and menopausal because her female hormones are decreasing, allowing the male hormones to have a greater affect on her skin. Keeping your face clean is a good beginning, and you may want to turn to some of the many acne medications on the market, but be aware that these are formulated for severe teen acne and will be very strong. If you wish to try these formulations, try them only every two or three days rather than on a daily basis. Use just a small amount and only directly on the lesions rather on your entire face. Watch what you put on your face. Steer clear of makeup and skin moisturizers that contain butyl stearate, lanolin, lauryl alcohol, oleic acid, vegetable butters, oils, and waxes.

Instead, youre getting baited with enticing words like lite, healthy, low fat, sugar free, or low calorie, when youre really buying items loaded with processed foods, fat and sugar. These fake-out foods carry a phony Health Halo and you need to be aware of the nutrition land mines out there, especially at restaurants. To help you navigate these challenges, here are some examples of food fake-outs complete with Health Halo and tips about how you can adapt and adjust with healthier options. Smoothies Problem: Something about that word smoothie just makes you want to down one right now. Buyer beware! Youll often end up guzzling 80 grams of sugar and over 300 calories in the blink of an eye. Solution: Know what goes into that drink. Be assertive. Ask for the list of ingredients if its being made for you. If youre making one yourself, or having one made for you, you dont need to drink any more than 8 ounces, use water, skim milk, or yogurt, and add fresh fruit and protein powder. If youre buying one premade, read the label carefully for number of servings per container, as well as total fat, carb and protein. Energy Bars Problem: It says energy and healthy and you go for it, not realizing that most of these are glorified candy bars. You can take in up to 500 calories and never know it. Solution: If you want to try one, read the label. Make sure the total calories doesnt excess 200, the total fat is not more than 10 grams, and no more than 4 grams of saturated fat, no more than 20 grams of carb and you want to see at least 5 grams of fiber and 10-20 grams of protein. I tend to recommend energy bars for those people who really need a snack to carry them over in places where they cant access whole food. For instance, road warriors who are stuck on planes and trains and travel delays and need a tie-me-over food. Sugar-Free, Fat-Free or Lite Foods Problem:These words will try to snag you every time. You see the word free or lite and youre hooked. Watch out! If a food is sugar-free, then its probably loaded with fat and if its fat-free its loaded with refined sugar. As for lite, that food is lighter relative to what? It could be a high fat item thats 10% less in fat, leaving it still a high fat item, but relatively speaking, its lighter. Solution: Personally, I eat real whole foods in balance. If you do find yourself in a position of buying one of these fat\/sugar free or low fat\/sugar or lite items, please read the label carefully! If its a lite food, make sure the total fat is low and the carb content (especially sugars) is no more than 20 grams or so, and hopefully theres at least 5-10 grams of protein per serving. For the fat\/sugar-free items, watch out for high fat (greater than 10 grams, and more than 5 grams saturated fat) or refined sugar content (greater than 25 grams). Fancy Water Problem: It looks perfectly innocent, and heck its water for crying out loud. What could be wrong? Everything! Many of these enhanced waters can be loaded with sugar. Solution: Read the label! Im sounding like a broken record, but you need to know what youre consuming. Many of these drinks can easily be 125 calories of diet wrecking sugary water per serving. If youre an athlete who is really sweating up a storm and is working out vigorously for hours on end, then they need these sports drinks to replenish glucose fuel and fortify with electrolytes. For everyone else, drink plain water when youre working out. Salad Bar Problem: Youre feeling particularly saintly as you head to the salad bar to grab some lunch. Youre entering a field of potential food landmines. You pile everything on your plate and munch away without realizing the amount of salt and fat youre ingesting. Solution: Those artichoke hearts, olives and chick peas were usually taken out of cans where they were preserved in lots of salt. If you want to consume them, wash them first. Choose low-salt options like lettuce, and fresh produce like peppers, mushrooms, onions, spinach, carrots and cucumbers.

And this is what they say. A review of the safety surveillance database revealed cases of intentional and accidental Zanaflex overdose. Some of the cases resulted in fatality and many of the intentional overdoses were with multiple drugs including CNS depressants. The clinical manifestations of tizanidine overdose were consistent with its known pharmacology . In the majority of cases a decrease in sensorium was observed including lethargy , somnolence , confusion and coma. Depressed cardiac function is also observed including most often bradycardia and hypotension . Respiratory depression is another common feature of tizanidine overdose. Should overdose occur, basic steps to ensure the adequacy of an airway and the monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory systems should be undertaken. Tizanidine is a lipid -soluble drug, which is only slightly soluble in water and methanol. Therefore, dialysis is not likely to be an efficient method of removing drug from the body. In general, symptoms resolve within one to three days following discontinuation of tizanidine and administration of appropriate therapy. Due to the similar mechanism of action, symptoms and management of tizanidine overdose are similar to that following clonidine overdose. For the most recent information concerning the management of overdose, contact a poison control center. Hope this helps.

Alternatively the lining can begin to shed under its own weight, producing prolonged bleeding. After several months of missed periods, the lining of the uterus can become very thickened. Prolonged and heavy flows are not uncommon after months of missed flows. There are MANY causes for not ovulating including low thyroid, a benign pituitary growth (adenoma), or a problem with the hypothalamus. All of the stress-related causes of not ovulating (e.g., sudden increases in exercise, crash dieting, problems with relationships, financial worries, etc.) can be linked to the effects of stress hormones from the brain on the hypothalamus. Increased body weight may trigger hormone changes leading to polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). A transient ovarian cyst can halt ovulation for a time. There are treatments for each of the causes of heavy bleeding we have discussed. So if you or someone you know have episodes of heavy blood loss rather than a normal period, talk to your doctor because there are ways to stop going with the flow.

Women have described it as \"having all my period flow within the first 48 hours--with spotting on either side\". If you are near this age group then the most likely explanation is a decline in progesterone produced by the ovaries as we age. If you are in your 20\\'s then the fear is that one may have had a miscarriage. Yet with a miscarriage bleeding tends to be prolonged. If you have any risk for pregnancy you should get a reliable pregnancy test. If the test is negative, my best GUESS would be a missed ovulation. This can trigger heavier (or lighter) flows than usual. Alas, this condition is difficult to confirm unless the woman has a history of erratic\/missed periods. In terms of the large clots\/tissue, when we send such specimens to the lab, the report returns as: white blood cells, red blood cells, fibrin, and other components of uterine lining tissue. It can look different as it is more solid that the liver-like consistence of blood clots. Many women worry that this is linked to a missed miscarriage, but that is not the usual explanation. When the bleeding is very heavy the volume of bleeding outstrips the enzyme produced by the lining of the uterus designed to keep the flow liquid (easier to pass through the cervical canal).

Some of our vegetables, like the cabbage family, have a bitter flavor and some people genetically are more tolerant to the bitter taste than others. Tip: Try these raw and you might like them better. * Fad dieting. People who were taught (while following diets in the past) to think of vegetables as rabbit diet food or legal diet food, due to their low calorie counts, can associate vegetables with horrible memories of crash dieting.

The term \"partial hysterectomy\" also can be used to mean the uterus and cervix were removed, but not the ovaries and fallopian tubes. Because you had your uterus removed, it is not possible for that organ to prolapse again. It is gone. I suppose it is possible for the cervix, itself, to prolapse (that is, to hang down outside the vaginal opening), but this would be relatively uncommon. More common would be a possible . This can occur when the muscles that hold the urinary bladder in place become weak and the bladder collapses down into the vaginal wall. This certainly could feel the same as a prolapsed uterus, and you may have symptoms such as pelvic pain, difficulty urinating, and tissue protruding from the vagina. I suggest you see your gynecologist or primary care provider to get this checked out.

The heart responds to the injury by remodeling itself in a way that lets it continue to do its job of pumping blood. This sometimes results in a stretching of the heart muscle. The condition may also be called dilated cardiomyopathy. The most common causes of cardiomegaly are: High blood pressure thats inadequately treated for a long time Coronary artery disease or heart attacks Alcohol abuse Viral myocarditis (heart infection by a virus) Postpartum cardiomyopathy (unexplained heart enlargement after delivering a baby) In many cases, no cause can be identified, which is called idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. The heart may also only appear enlarged on a chest X-ray (the traditional way doctors have diagnosed cardiomegaly). An abnormal amount of fluid around a normal-sized heart (pericardial effusion) will deceptively enlarge the hearts shadow on a chest X-ray film.

This is in part because women tend to seek medical care later than men, and in part because diagnosing heart attacks in women can sometimes be more difficult than diagnosing heart attacks in men. The reasons include: Women are more likely than men to have atypical heart attack symptoms such as: Neck and shoulder pain. Abdominal pain. Nausea. Vomiting. Fatigue. Shortness of breath. Silent heart attacks (heart attacks with little or no symptoms) are more common among women than among men. Women have a higher occurrence than men of chest pain that is not caused by heart disease, for example chest pain from spasm of the esophagus. Women are less likely than men to have the typical findings on the ECG that are necessary to diagnose a heart attack quickly. Women are more likely than men to have angina (chest pain due to lack of blood supply to the heart muscle) that is caused by spasm of the coronary arteries or caused by disease of the smallest blood vessels (microvasculature disease). Cardiac catheterization with coronary angiograms (X-ray studies of the coronary arteries that are considered the most reliable tests for CAD) will reveal normal coronary arteries and therefore cannot be used to diagnose either of these two conditions. Women are more likely to have misleading, or \"false positive\" noninvasive tests for CAD then men. Because of the atypical nature of symptoms and the occasional difficulties in diagnosing heart attacks in women, women are less likely to receive aggressive thrombolytic therapy or coronary angioplasty, and are more likely to receive it later than men. Women also are less likely to be admitted to a coronary care unit.

Women may certainly experience chest pain, but they should also be on the lookout for less obvious symptoms, like nausea, indigestion, and palpitations in addition to shortness of breath and back pain. In fact, nearly half of the women in one study had no chest pain at all during their heart attack. Fatigue and shortness of breath were the most common symptoms.

Heart attacks typically occur when the heart muscle cannot obtain a sufficient amount of oxygen. The lack of oxygen may cause the heart to beat faster and thus requiring even more oxygen. The lack of oxygen and blockage of the heart (usually by fats), causes the heart to eventually flutter or vibrate until it eventually stops beating. A pacemaker is programed to regulate the heart by sending out electrical pulsations to help the heart beat at regular intervals, but will not necessarily prevent a heart attack. In essence, the pacemaker replaces the hearts electrical system, but has no effect on blocked blood vessels. Without the pacemaker, some people would have a heart that beat too slowly, to rapidly, or irregularly (arrhythmias). A heart that beats too slowly, too fast, or irregularly may cause organ failure, fatigue, and even death.

Losing about 22 pounds will lower your risk, Regular physical activity can help women protect themselves from breast cancer. Engaging in, say, fast walking for 10 hours or more per week can benefit women immensely. Drinking alcohol has definitely been shown to be a risk factor and the more one drinks, the higher the risk.

Strategies can be designed to help you regain a sense of control over your life and improve your quality of life, something everyone deserves. If necessary, medicine to treat depression may be prescribed. Support Groups. Support groups are a very useful sharing experience.

A common cause of itch is psychological, that is, due to stress, anxiety, etc. Stress also can aggravate itch from other causes. Dry skin (xerosis) is another frequent cause of itch. Many people also report sunburn itch following prolonged exposure to UV radiation from the sun. Other causes of generalized itching that may not produce a rash or specific skin changes include metabolic and endocrine disorders (for example, liver or kidney disease, hyperthyroidism), cancers (for example, lymphoma), reactions to drugs, and interruptions in bile flow (cholestasis), diseases of the blood (for example, polycythemia vera). Itching is common with allergic reactions. Itching can also result from insect stings and bites such as from mosquito or flea bites. Infections and infestations of the skin are another cause of itch. Genital itching, which may accompany burning and pain, in men and women can occur as a result of genital infections such as sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Vaginal itching is sometimes referred to as feminine itching, and sexually transmitted diseases can also cause anal itching. Other common infectious causes of itch include a fungal infection of the crotch (tinea cruris) commonly known as jock itch, psoriasis, and ringworm of the body (tinea corporis), as well as vaginal itching (sometimes referred to as feminine itching) and\/or anal itching from sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) or other types of infections, such as vaginal yeast infections. Another type of parasitic infection resulting in itch is the so-called swimmer\\'s itch. Swimmer\\'s itch, also called cercarial dermatitis, is a skin rash caused by an allergic reaction to infection with certain parasites of birds and mammals that are released from infected snails in fresh and saltwater. Itch may also result from skin infestation by body lice, including head lice and pubic lice. Scabies is a highly contagious skin condition caused by an infestation by the itch mite Sarcoptes scabiei that is known to cause an intense itch that is particularly severe at night. Itching can also result from conditions that affect the nerves, such as diabetes, shingles (herpes zoster), or multiple sclerosis. Irritation of the skin from contact with fabrics, cosmetics, or other substances can lead to itching that may be accompanied by rash. Reactions to drugs or medications can also result in widespread itching that may be accompanied by a rash or hives.

Eczema , which can be treated with creams, prescription medications, and in the case of allergic people, avoiding whatever it is that makes them react. Food allergies , which many people dont realize are responsible for the generalized itching that makes them so uncomfortable.

Scabies , tiny mites that burrow in skin and cause intense itching. Scabies is a highly contagious condition which can spread anywhere where groups of people live in close quarters, from prisons to expensive summer camps. Treatment requires a prescription cream and meticulous washing and drying of clothing, bed linens and towels.

A thin membrane called the pleura covers the outer surface of the lung. The air we breathe gets into the lung through an airway (path for air). The airway consists of the oral and nasal cavities, which connect to the voice box (larynx), which connects to the windpipe (trachea). The windpipe splits into two air passages called bronchi, one going to each lung (right and left main bronchi). The trachea and larger bronchi contain C-shaped rigid bars of cartilage in their walls. The cartilage helps to keep the airway from collapsing when there is negative pressure in the airway, as occurs when we breathe in (inhale or inspire). The right lung has three separate sections (upper, middle, and lower lobes), while the left lung has just an upper and a lower lobe. Each lobe has its own bronchi and blood supply. Further along in the airway, within the lung, the bronchi continue to divide into ever-smaller (narrower) tubes, much like the branches of a tree. (Hence, the term tracheobronchial tree .) The walls of the bronchi contain muscles that can cause the airway to expand (widen) or contract (narrow). For example, during exercise, the airway expands to increase airflow (ventilation). Conversely, when exposed to polluted or very cold air, the airway contracts to protect the downstream tissues from injury. The smaller branches of the bronchial tree, called bronchioles, also contain muscle, but they lack cartilage.

A 70 year old female who is 5\\'4\" might have a vital capacity somewhere in the range of 2.3. As you can see, our lung capacity decreases with age. One medical source reports that our lung capacity may only be half of what it was during our younger years. To put that fact into proper prospective, the same 5\\'4\" woman at the age of 30 would have been expected to have had a lung capacity of 3.2. In summary, all the doctor does is look at your spirometer test result number along with your height. The doctor then looks at the chart to see which age group your result falls into. If your results fall into an age group that is older than you really are, your lungs are not performing normally which can impact longevity. I hope that this answer has been helpful.

So first she put me on birth control so I wouldn\\'t have a period. That fixed that problem... but just that problem. Eventually she had to refer me to a specialist. Turns out it\\'s a legit problem! I can\\'t say for certainty what your issue is, but I have vulvar vestibulitis. There were several therapies\/ fixes for it. The best and the easiest shocked me: stop using scented soap down there. I used to be an avid Bath and Body Works user... for everything! And when I want to be clean, I mean business. Apparently, that\\'s a no-no. So now I use whatever body wash I want for all other areas of my body, but when I wash my lady-parts I only use a wet wash cloth. That\\'s it. Nothing on it. I\\'m surprised that it cleans\/ smells exactly the same as it did with heavily purfumed soap. And holy cow, it made a world of difference on the pain! It didn\\'t take it away obviously, but it eased it a lot. Other big no-nos include douching and inserting anything foreign\/ unclean (like a man\\'s dirty fingernails or any household object... I know, no fun. But if you\\'re gonna use it, just clean it off first!! And may I recommend ice? strangely pleasurable and no cleaning required.) Also reccommended is getting a physical therapist. I know, WEIRD. (\"Excuse me, do you have any therapists in you facility that can help me strengthen my vagina?\") But find one that will help you work you *pelvic floor muscles*. It\\'s important! And the other thing the specialist did was give me a prescription cream. Whenever the pain becomes unbearable (or when I think it\\'s about to become unbearable) I rub some on. It\\'s just kind of like a numbing ointment. Not very good for sex, but for tampons or an OBGYN appt it works. And last thing... you\\'ve got to be totally open with you\\'re boyfriend. Tell him that the first few times you have sex probably won\\'t be fun for either of you. he\\'ll have to hold back a lot and be very gentle, and it\\'ll probably be painful for you.

With correct positioning and usage the Mooncup can be used by women with an IUD.

You may choose to discuss this with your doctor\/nurse\/gynaecologist if you have concerns or you feel that your Mooncup may interfere with your IUD strings. We would recommend; When an IUD has first been inserted, you should wait six weeks before using a Mooncup (or any internal sanitary protection) Remember to place the Mooncup low in the vagina and ensure you have an adequate seal (read more about Mooncup positioning) It is important to always release the seal before removing a Mooncup. After each period, check you can still feel the IUD strings. If you cannot feel them, think that your IUD\/IUS has moved or is causing\/has caused you pain, use another form of contraception such as a condom until you have had your IUD checked by a doctor\/medical professional.

Because their kidneys weren\\'t functioning properly, their bodies couldn\\'t remove the aluminum fast enough, and it began accumulating. Scientists noticed that dialysis patients who had these high aluminum levels were more likely to develop dementia. As a result, the FDA requires antiperspirant labels to carry a warning that reads, \"Ask a doctor before use if you have kidney disease.\" Yet this warning is only meant for people whose kidneys are functioning at 30% or less. In reality, it\\'s almost impossible to absorb enough aluminum through the skin to harm the kidneys. \"Unless you eat your stick or spray it into your mouth, your body can\\'t absorb that much aluminum,\" says nephrologist Leslie Spry, MD, FACP, spokesperson for the National Kidney Foundation.

Transthoracic echocardiogram: This is the standard echocardiogram. It is a painless test similar to X-ray, but without the radiation. The procedure uses the same technology used to evaluate a baby\\'s health before birth. A hand-held device called a transducer is placed on the chest and transmits high frequency sound waves (ultrasound). These sound waves bounce off the heart structures, producing images and sounds that can be used by the doctor to detect heart damage and disease. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE): This test requires that the transducer be inserted down the throat into the esophagus (the swallowing tube that connects the mouth to the stomach). Because the esophagus is located close to the heart, clear images of the heart structures can be obtained without the interference of the lungs and chest. Stress echocardiogram: This is an echocardiogram that is performed while the person exercises on a treadmill or stationary bicycle. This test can be used to visualize the motion of the heart\\'s walls and pumping action when the heart is stressed. It may reveal a lack of blood flow that isn\\'t always apparent on other heart tests. The echocardiogram is performed just prior and just after the exercise. Dobutamine stress echocardiogram: This is another form of stress echocardiogram. However, instead of exercising to stress the heart, the stress is obtained by giving a drug that stimulates the heart and makes it \"think\" it is exercising. The test is used to evaluate your heart and valve function when you are unable to exercise on a treadmill or stationary bike. It is also used to determine how well your heart tolerates activity and your likelihood of having coronary artery disease (blocked arteries), as well as evaluating the effectiveness of your cardiac treatment plan. Intravascular ultrasound: This is a form of echocardiography performed during cardiac catheterization. During this procedure, the transducer is threaded into the heart blood vessels via a catheter in the groin. It is often used to provide detailed information about the atherosclerosis (blockage) inside the blood vessels.

The first and higher of the two is a measure of systolic pressure, or the pressure in the arteries when the heart beats and fills them with blood. The second number measures diastolic pressure, or the pressure in the arteries when the heart rests between beats. Normal blood pressure rises steadily from about 90\/60 at birth to about 120\/80 in a healthy adult. If someone were to take your blood pressure immediately after you\\'d delivered a speech or jogged five miles, the reading would undoubtedly seem high. This is not necessarily cause for alarm: It\\'s natural for blood pressure to rise and fall with changes in activity or emotional state. It\\'s also normal for blood pressure to vary from person to person, even from one area of your body to another. But when blood pressure remains consistently high, talk with your doctor about treatment. Consistently high blood pressure forces the heart to work far beyond its capacity. Along with injuring blood vessels, hypertension can damage the brain, eyes, and kidneys. People with blood pressure readings of 140\/90 or higher, taken on at least two occasions, are said to have high blood pressure. If the pressure remains high, your doctor will probably begin treatment. People with blood pressure readings of 200\/120 or higher need treatment immediately. People with diabetes are treated if their blood pressure rises above 130\/80, since they already have a high risk of heart disease. Researchers identified people with blood pressures slightly higher than 120\/80 as a category at high risk for developing hypertension. This condition is called prehypertension and affects an estimated 50 million American men and women. Prehypertension is now known to increase the likelihood of damage to arteries and the heart, brain, and kidneys, so many doctors are now recommending early treatment, though there is no evidence that this helps in the long run.

A blood pressure of 140\/100, for example, would be considered \"high blood pressure,\" even though the pulse pressure of 40 is considered normal.

Every summer, parents bring their kids in with curious little rashes that just dont seem to go away. They are tiny, firm, raised, flesh-colored bumps that often show up in the armpit, the back of the knees, the trunk, the forearm or the inner thigh. (The only place they dont show up are the palms and soles.) So what are they? A virus. Yes, these tiny warts are caused by a virus. And yes, that means they are contagious. They spread from person-to-person by direct contact with the spots. And, kids can spread them around their own bodies by scratching and picking at them. The spots are kind of itchy, but they are really more of a nuisance than a serious health issue. Kids with eczema tend to have more problems because the itchy spots lead to scratching which leads to eczema flare-ups. If left alone, the molluscum eventually goes away. But, eventually can mean 6 months or 4 YEARS. Molluscum isnt just a summer virus, but I do see more kids with it after spending their summer in the swimming pool. Studies looking at the ability of the virus to spread in a chlorinated pool have been inconclusive thus far. Thus, there are no regulations restricting kids from public swimming pools when theyve got those spots. (Besides the fact that one in 10 kids would have to stay out of a pool if there was a rule thats how common molluscum is!) The molluscum virus also seems to spread through non-chlorinated water (like your bathtub). If one of your kids has molluscum, do not let him share a bath or a drying off towel with your other kids. About 40% of kids with molluscum will spread it to their sibling. If you want to get rid of the molluscum before they decide to go away on their own, I suggest speaking to your childs doctor or consulting a dermatologist. There are a variety of methods, none of which is 100% successful or pain-free. So, you should consider the options before proceeding.

An important step toward answering that question came in 1993 when scientists supported by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) discovered that mutations in the gene that produces the SOD1 enzyme were associated with some cases of familial ALS. This enzyme is a powerful antioxidant that protects the body from damage caused by free radicals. Free radicals are highly reactive molecules produced by cells during normal metabolism. If not neutralized, free radicals can accumulate and cause random damage to the DNA and proteins within cells. Although it is not yet clear how the SOD1 gene mutation leads to motor neuron degeneration, researchers have theorized that an accumulation of free radicals may result from the faulty functioning of this gene. In support of this, animal studies have shown that motor neuron degeneration and deficits in motor function accompany the presence of the SOD1 mutation. Studies also have focused on the role of glutamate in motor neuron degeneration. Glutamate is one of the chemical messengers or neurotransmitters in the brain. Scientists have found that, compared to healthy people, ALS patients have higher levels of glutamate in the serum and spinal fluid. Laboratory studies have demonstrated that neurons begin to die off when they are exposed over long periods to excessive amounts of glutamate. Now, scientists are trying to understand what mechanisms lead to a buildup of unneeded glutamate in the spinal fluid and how this imbalance could contribute to the development of ALS. Autoimmune responses--which occur when the body\\'s immune system attacks normal cells -- have been suggested as one possible cause for motor neuron degeneration in ALS. Some scientists theorize that antibodies may directly or indirectly impair the function of motor neurons, interfering with the transmission of signals between the brain and muscles. In searching for the cause of ALS, researchers have also studied environmental factors such as exposure to toxic or infectious agents. Other research has examined the possible role of dietary deficiency or trauma. However, as of yet, there is insufficient evidence to implicate these factors as causes of ALS. Future research may show that many factors, including a genetic predisposition, are involved in the development of ALS.

However, when both parents are obese, the children have an 80 percent chance of being obese. 2) The factor that puts children at greatest risk of being overweight is having obese parents. 3) The three most significant elements contributing to obesity in a childs life are: a) not eating meals together; b) not limiting TV time and not taking the TV out of the childs bedroom; and, c) not getting at least eight hours of sleep. All of these factors are influenced by the parents lifestyle and choices for the kids. Obesity in kids and teens is associated with higher levels of depression brought on by the desperate need to want to pass the acid approval of their skinnier peers. Obese kids are more likely to be bullied. Overweight and obese girls appear to be undergoing earlier onset of menses. And one in five kids has an elevated cholesterol level. Scientists predict that heavy kids will go on to develop heart disease and type 2 diabetes at much earlier ages. I could go on, but you get the picture. For everyone, here are steps you can take right now to become a better role model for healthy living: 1) Get the family on board with healthy nutrition. Make an appointment with a registered dietitian who can sit down with you and map out a strategy for tasty, nutritious food plans. Get the guidance you need from multiple resources. Check out the terrific support you can get from WebMDs offerings in nutrition and fitness. 2) Plan for success. If you fail to plan, you plan to fail. Look ahead at the week and plan each days menus and activities. Have enough healthy food options available so theres no excuse for anyone grabbing junk. Get the kids signed up for as many fun and challenging activities that their schedule will allow. 3) Enlist family members to help with grocery shopping and food preparation. Make eating healthfully a family affair. Assign tasks to each person so that they have pride in knowing they contributed to preparing any meal. Challenge your kids to hit the internet and learn something new about the food they eat. 4) Know what your kids are eating at school. In the best situation, youre preparing their lunch and they take it with them. However, thats not always possible. If the food being offered isnt optimal, make your voice heard and push for change. 5) Sit down together and eliminate tech-interrupted meals. Get away from the TV, turn off cell phones, and put away iPods, iPads and video games. Hey, why not do something radical like sit at a table and talk to one another. This is a prime opportunity for parents to catch up with kids lives and vice versa. 6) Stop using food as a reward. So many exhausted parents simply give in and feed kids the junk they love while they veg out in front of the tube or computer. Fight the urge to take the easy way out. I know its so hard at times, but remember that youre setting a foundation for their future lives. Theyll use food for themselves just as youve taught them. 7) Get up and move more. Parents have to make up for the fact that physical education classes are now so limited and most recesses have evolved into opportunities to text and hit video games. No one moves anymore. Parents need to create fun ways to incorporate more activity into every day. 8) Each family member needs to own their nutrition and activity plan. Everyone needs to honor their unique needs and to learn how to create and stick with a blueprint for eating and exercising that works. 9) Be patient. Behavior takes time to change. You need to keep practicing new behaviors on a regular basis to make them stick. 10) Get the kids to sleep on time. Kids and teens need no less than 8-9 hours of sleep each night. Its up to you to make certain that happens. Theyre watching you skimp on sleep, and they think its OK to do the same. Adults and kids who get the sleep they need have fewer weight issues and have the energy to be productive and happy members of society. 11) Realize the life giving win-win youre achieving. Just as youre helping your kids, youre helping yourself. This is a royal double win. As you learn, you can be a better teacher. Youll live a longer and higher quality of life, watching your kids, your very healthy kids, grow up and pass their lessons onto their own families.

As you know, this isnt a new concept  smokers will tell you that the cost of cigarettes has skyrocketed over the past 15 years. But as recent emphasis on the obesity epidemic has renewed our interests in healthier lifestyle choices, many have suggested that taxing highly processed foods or higher calorie foods with little nutritional value might be a good next step. The government, in effect, could enforce a pricing structure which would essentially penalize certain food choices, with the goal of ultimately changing behavior. Enter the soda tax. So whats the next step? There are lots of strong opinions on either side. Those in favor emphasize the staggering impact of obesity on the health-care system and our economy and the need to do something more than we are currently. Those against it go back to the role of government and concerns that this is a slippery slope to a Big Brother that we wouldnt want to have, looking over our shoulders and telling us how to live our lives. Interestingly, were not still hearing the same debate about cigarette taxes. Why? People finally seem to understand that smoking causes heart attacks, emphysema, lung cancer and early death. People also recognize that laws preventing smoking in restaurants and bars as well as pricier cigarettes are felt to be playing a role in a decreased prevalence of smoking. In effect, we have evidence that the policies are working. Not working perfectly  and not everyone likes them  but they seem to be working. And its hard for either side of the aisle to take away a policy that seems to be effective. One of the challenges with the current soda tax proposals is that we just dont have the evidence we need to put them into wide effect. At the recent Obesity Society meeting in San Diego, researchers presented several mathematical models examining how a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages (i.e. soda) would impact behavior, and ultimately the obesity problem. One study suggested that taxing soda by about 20 percent would be associated with a 20 percent reduction in excess gain in body mass index among children. Another study found that a penny-per-ounce tax (adding about a quarter to the price of your bottle of soda) could decrease consumption by close to 25 percent, thereby reducing health care costs by $50 billion in ten years, and generating $150 billion in revenue over the same time frame. That money that could be invested in fighting obesity by expanding educational programs or even subsidizing the costs of more expensive, but healthier foods. Sounds intriguing, doesnt it? True, a computer model wont be enough to convince a lot of people. But at least the beverage corporations are listening  the American Beverage Association is reportedly spending close to ten times what it was five years ago in lobbying efforts to avoid these types of taxing proposals from gaining too much momentum.

The good news is that most women agree that obesity is a major issue. This survey was unique because its woman-centric, updating us about how women currently view the impact of obesity on their daily lives. The online survey was conducted within the United States by Harris Interactive on behalf of the national non-profit association HealthyWomen. From August 24-26, 2010, 1,037 women ages 18 and older participated. After reviewing the survey results, a number of disconnects began to emerge. Here are some highlights from the survey: 1. Although 87 percent of women believe that there is a parental role in the cycle of obesity, only 28 percent assign any responsibility to themselves. Fifty-seven percent believed that a mother and father have equal influence on their childs potential for obesity. Reality: Research shows that a mothers obesity has a much great impact than a fathers on their child at all ages. Moms are still primarily in charge of grocery shopping and meal preparation. Kids tend to emulate their moms eating patterns. 2. One in 10 women surveyed recognized that if she were obese in her first trimester, her obesity more than doubles her childs risk of becoming obese. Forty-six percent of women didnt know if there was a mother-child obesity connection in pregnancy and 11 percent felt there was no connection at all. Reality: Research from Harvard Medical School shows that the more weight a woman gains while pregnant, the greater the childs chances are of being overweight by the age of three. Currently, one in five women is obese at the time of her babys conception, which translates into 1.3 million annually. 3. Eighty percent of women believe that outside relationships can influence their becoming obese. Seventy-two percent believe an obese family member can affect their obesity risk. Sixty percent think that a spouse or partner will significantly impact on their becoming obese or not. Less than one in three believes an obese friend can influence their weight. Reality: Research shows that a woman has a greater chance of becoming obese if her friend does. There is a less effect for sibling or spouse. 4. While 97 percent of women knew that obesity is associated with an increased risk of heart disease and diabetes, only: a) Thirty percent knew that it was also associated with gallstones and infertility; b) Twenty-five percent knew it could increase the risk of colon and breast cancer; c) And, only 13 percent knew about the obesity-uterine cancer connection. The bottom line from this survey is that all women need to embrace and integrate these new facts into a new normal attitude about healthy lifestyles.

The bodys normal response to infection is a process called inflammation. When inflammation is confined to one area of infection (like a wound or a pneumonia), the natural chemicals released help fight and control the infection. In septic shock, these inflammatory chemicals spread through the bloodstream, where they dont belong. These chemicals, and substances released by bacteria, cause blood pressure to fall to dangerously low levels. Antibiotics are the most important treatment for septic shock. However, antibiotics alone dont correct septic shock, because the bodys response to the infection is as harmful as the infection itself. Intravenous medicines to increase blood pressure (vasopressors) are needed during septic shock. Many people with septic shock become unconscious, and some require mechanical ventilation (life support) to breathe. Septic shock can be fatal, and there are few effective treatments. In most cases, treatment means providing life support until antibiotics and the persons immune system clear the infection, and the massive inflammatory process subsides.

LiFraumeni syndrome is an extremely rare autosomal dominant hereditary disorder. Named after Frederick Pei Li and Joseph F. Fraumeni, Jr., the American physicians who first recognized and described the syndrome,[1] LiFraumeni syndrome greatly increases susceptibility to cancer. This syndrome is also known as the Sarcoma, breast, leukaemia and adrenal gland (SBLA) syndrome. The syndrome is linked to germline mutations of the TP53 tumor suppressor gene,[2] which normally helps control cell growth. The mutations can be inherited or can arise de novo early in embryogenesis or in one of the parent\\'s germ cells. The TP53 gene is responsible for initiating DNA repair mechanisms and\/or apoptosis upon detection of DNA damage.\" P53 is a dominant negative mutation, so the mutant protein can inactivate the normal protein, meaning the mutant protein is dominant. Because of this, LiFraumeni syndrome, with one of the two p53 copies already mutated, predisposes a person to cancer development. Persons with LiFraumeni syndrome have an approximately 25-fold increased risk of developing a malignant tumor by age 50 than the population average, and are at risk for a wide range of malignancies, with particularly high occurrences of breast cancer, brain tumors, acute leukemia, soft tissue sarcomas, bone sarcomas, and adrenal cortical carcinoma.

The first is please follow our instructions, and if youre having pain, take a pain medicine, because if you dont, and youre trying to be stoic, your blood pressure is going to go up as a result of pain and that can translate into more bruising for example. At worse, it can cause such increased bleeding under the skin that the wound can just pop apart. So, follow the instructions. Secondly, please dont smoke. We hope you never smoke, but for sure, dont smoke after surgery. It delays the healing and it compromises lung function. Theres not a single good thing you can say about smoking, only bad. Thirdly, dont lay around the house, and do nothing. With cosmetic surgery, you dont need to be bed bound by more than one day or so. By the next day, you can be up and about. Now you may not want to go to an amusement park, but you can certainly take a walk around your house. If the weathers nice, go out, get some fresh air. Why? Because if you dont, if you just lay around the house, youre going to be subject to constipation, a very practical issue. Youve got to get moving, because youve been taking some pain pills perhaps. Most pain pills will produce some level of constipation. You counter that by getting up, getting around, and by the way, drink lots of fluids, drink fruit juices. Again, we tell everybody this. Its in writing. This is what they should do. We tell them what they shouldnt do. What they shouldnt do is go back to the health club three days later and start pumping iron, because the blood pressure is going to go up again. Elevated blood pressure after surgery is one of our greatest enemies because of the bruising issue and the bleeding issue, so its generally 10 days before you can go back to your health club, and maybe even 2 weeks, depending on how things are going, but well be monitoring, and again, because were going to see the patient often, particularly after the bigger procedures, were going to see them several times the first week, were going to be asking these questions every day. Hows it going? Are you out and about? Are you getting a little fresh air? Are you moving your body parts? Hows it going in the constipation or no constipation department? How are you eating? Occasionally somebody, they just stop eating for whatever reason, not a good idea. Why? You need protein. You need carbohydrates. Your body has to repair itself. Were big on vitamins as long as they are the right vitamins and we know about them, and were big on just plain old, good old nutrition. What role does sleep have in my recovery? Some patients will not sleep well. They will not sleep well because they are either anxious or their sleep cycle has been upset even by the anesthetic, or they are not sleeping well because maybe theres a little bit of discomfort. So the first line of defense is pain medication, but if patients dont take the pain medication say Im not sleeping well, then my answer is going to be then were going to do two things, we are going to remind you to take the pain medicine and if that doesnt quite give you the level of comfort and relaxation, heres a sleeping pill. We dont want people not to sleep. Ill tell you why. First of all, they get cranky. They just get cranky, they are not having any fun, and theyll just feel better and everything goes better, so yes, sleep is very important and we have to monitor these things. Again, theres almost a checklist we go through, and its about eating and about exercise and about not smoking and again, even sleep.

I dont think a free consultation is a good idea. First of all, it implies that you dont think its worth paying for. In other words, if the patient doesnt want to pay for service, the patient should want to pay for service. Its very important service, because the answer may be that its not a good idea to have cosmetic surgery for x, y, and z reasons. And youre going to get an honest opinion, because youre paying for the doctors time. Otherwise, often, its kind of like a little bit of a come on, frankly, in some practices, particularly practices that are high marketing, high advertising, more of a clinic, different atmosphere than other practices. It makes it attractive to patients that say, oh yeah, its free, what do I have to lose? But often, they come in, and then they are taken down a little road that they may not want to go to, because sometimes, theres some pretty sophisticated marketing. By the way, some of these clinics are owned by businessmen. Doctors are employees. They just see this as another business, and they hire a doctor, just like a factory hires a line worker. So often, its kind of a, its a little bit unclear, hang on a second its an opening into what turns out to be too much of a slick operation. Medical consultation should be professional and it shouldnt be a hustle. It shouldnt be slick, and you shouldnt feel pressured and sometimes people are. Because frankly, if everyone came in and consulted at no charge, how could the clinic stay in business if it didnt do surgery? Now, its now likely, certainly a fair percentage need something, but I think its healthier to pay for it. And frankly, for many practices, that $200 or $150 or whatever the number is, they apply it to the procedure anyway if youre comfortable or the doctors comfortable doing it, so at least in that practice, it really hasnt cost you any more to consult. If youre going to do consulting with 3 or 4 practices, yes, you could say wow, $150 or $200, Im going to be investing a fair amount of money, but you know, youre also talking about a procedure that may be is thousands of dollars, they are thousands most of the time, certainly the bigger procedures like face lifting, breast reduction, tummy tucks, its still a good investment, because youre going to learn. In my experience, the practices that charge you for the consultation give you a lot more education. The practices that dont charge you give you a lot more selling. But I dont think you should be sold on this. I dont think its something that you need to be drawn into. I think you have to approach it as a very, very important consumer decision. It is your face, it is your body, even your health is on the line, to a tiny, tiny degree. So, I think it is better to pay for the consultation.

Thats number one. Second , is the facility accredited? Now, accreditation is kind of a broad term. For instance, the facility could be licensed by the state. States do that. Hospitals are licensed. The state will license a facility. The federal government does the same. In other words, you cannot operate on a Medicare patient and expect Medicare to pay for it unless theyve given it the stamp of approval. By the way, the standards are almost identical. And some facilities, for whatever reason will have both the state and the federal government come in, do their evaluation and asked to be approved. But there are also private credentialing companies that do this, and by the way most hospitals in the United States are accredited by essentially what is called the Joint Commission. Its called the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Facilities. This licenses hospitals, outpatient surgery centers, radiology x-ray clinics. So, again, very high standards, so that there is no A or B, its all A. If you get the right answers to those questions, youll feel comfortable. And I would tell you also, parenthetically, most of the doctor anesthesiologists that I know will not work in an unaccredited, unlicensed facility, because they would be compromised in the performance of their work. For example, if the facility didnt have all the appropriate life support systems, why would the anesthesiologist want to be in the situation where if anything goes wrong, he doesnt have the technical backup. He doesnt want to be in that position. He wants to deliver to the patient when needed, if needed, as remote as that possibility is, he wants to deliver the best he has.

In some people, it can be related to stress, too much caffeine or nicotine, or too much exercise. But sometimes, PVCs can be caused by heart disease or electrolyte imbalance. People who have a lot of PVCs, and\/or symptoms associated with them, should be evaluated by a heart doctor. However, in most people, PVCs are usually harmless and rarely need treatment. Atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is a very common irregular heart rhythm that causes the atria, the upper chambers of the heart, to contract abnormally. Atrial flutter. This is an arrhythmia caused by one or more rapid circuits in the atrium. Atrial flutter is usually more organized and regular than atrial fibrillation. This arrhythmia occurs most often in people with heart disease and in the first week after heart surgery. It often converts to atrial fibrillation. Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT). A rapid heart rate, usually with a regular rhythm, originating from above the ventricles. PSVT begins and ends suddenly. There are two main types: accessory path tachycardias and AV nodal reentrant tachycardias (see below). Accessory pathway tachycardias . A rapid heart rate due to an extra abnormal pathway or connection between the atria and the ventricles. The impulses travel through the extra pathways as well as through the usual route. This allows the impulses to travel around the heart very quickly, causing the heart to beat unusually fast. AV nodal reentrant tachycardia. A rapid heart rate due to more than one pathway through the AV node. It can cause heart palpitations, fainting, or heart failure. In some cases, it can be terminated using simple maneuvers, such as breathing in and bearing down. Some drugs can also stop this heart rhythm. Ventricular tachycardia (V-tach). A rapid heart rhythm originating from the lower chambers (or ventricles) of the heart. The rapid rate prevents the heart from filling adequately with blood. This can be a serious arrhythmia, especially in people with heart disease, and may be associated with more symptoms. Ventricular fibrillation. An erratic, disorganized firing of impulses from the ventricles. The ventricles quiver and are unable to contract or pump blood to the body. This is a medical emergency that must be treated with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation as soon as possible. Long QT syndrome. The QT interval is the area on the electrocardiogram that represents the time it takes for the heart muscle to contract and then recover, or for the electrical impulse to fire impulses and then recharge. When the QT interval is longer than normal, it increases the risk of a life-threatening form of ventricular tachycardia. Long QT syndrome is an inherited condition that can cause sudden death in young people. It can be treated with antiarrhythmic drugs, pacemaker, electrical cardioversion, defibrillation, implanted cardioverter\/defibrillator, or ablation therapy. Bradyarrhythmias. These are slow heart rhythms, which may arise from disease in the heart\\'s electrical conduction system. Examples include sinus node dysfunction and heart block. Sinus node dysfunction. A slow heart rhythm due to an abnormal sinus node. Significant sinus node dysfunction that causes symptoms is treated with a pacemaker. Heart block. A delay or complete block of the electrical impulse as it travels from the sinus node to the ventricles. The heart may beat irregularly and, often, more slowly. If serious, heart block is treated with a pacemaker.

The earlobes are pretty nifty gadgets. They are utilitarian; they can be pierced so that studs or earrings can be passed through the channel or earrings can be clipped on. Nature had a good idea to facilitate wearing jewelry. Sometimes, the earlobes get into a little trouble. For those with rather thin lobes who favor wearing heavy earrings, after the lobes have been pierced, there can be a gradual elongation of the ear piercing tract such that it becomes slit-like and often too large. Another problem is that the earlobes can be torn by accident if undue pressure is placed upon an already elongated ear piercing tract through the natural forces of the heavy earring or even by a playful child tugging on a dangling earring. The repair of such is not simple. It is important that it be well done so that the earlobe looks normal and without overt evidence of having been torn and then repaired. We favor a three-layer repair done under hypermagnification. It is an office procedure done under local anesthesia. But it is very important to remove the damaged ear piercing tract or to trim the edges of a cleft if the earlobe has been torn through completely. Then the three-layer closure consists of closing the outer layer of skin, the fatty tissue between the two layers of the skin and finally skin in the back of the lobe. Typically, the surgery must take great pains to avoiding any notching at the bottom of the earlobe. Such a repair is all technique-dependent. The surgeon needs to have the skill, the experience and the patience to do a first-class job. People ask if the ears can be pierced again. They can. Typically you should wait two months after the lobe has been repaired before initiating a repaired earlobe piercing.

As most people know, blood sugar levels rise after eating. In imperfectly controlled diabetes, the blood sugar levels often rise higher and longer than in people without diabetes, or than in patients with well-controlled diabetes. For example, normal people without diabetes might peak at 140 mg\/dL about 60 minutes after a meal, whereas someone with moderately-well controlled diabetes might peak at 200 mg\/dL about 90 minutes after a meal. This is because the beta cells of the pancreas are unable to provide enough insulin to keep the blood sugar levels in the normal range. When people with diabetes find their blood sugar level to be unexpectedly high, they might call it a \"spike\". This typically happens after eating a rich meal or a sequence of rich meals. by rich I mean high in starch and\/or sugar plus animal fat. The starch\/sugar raise the blood sugar, and the fat helps keep the sugar levels high by blocking the insulin from working efficiently. Pizza, ice cream, pasta with butter, etc. Note that the timing of the blood sugar testing will have much to do with one\\'s perception of whether the blood sugar has \"spiked\". In my view, a \"spike\" is just a snapshot view of a chronic problem. The realy problem is not the \"spike\"--it is a reminder that eating right and exercise are a daily priority, and spikes will be common whenever these priorities are not addressed. Use the A1c level to make decisions (with your health care providers) about diabetes management because it reflects the overall glucose control. The frequency or peak of glucose spikes can add supplemental information, but I do not believe that lifestyle goals and habits should be based on treating individual spikes. To use an analogy--some might say the best way to invest in the stock market is not to react to spikes in the price of a certain stock but to make decisions based on long-term trends and a the big picture.

Assuming you\\'re awake and alert and realize your blood sugar has dipped, you can eat a sugary treat, such as a SMALL candy bar, to bring your sugar level back up. Note: No one should attempt to feed sugar to an unconscious or unresponsive person, even if you know low blood sugar is the cause. You should call 9-1-1 or your local emergency number, instead. Of course, it\\'s not a good idea to ever let your blood sugar level get too low. One goal of diabetes management is to maintain blood sugar within a therapeutic range.

That said, if you go around measuring your blood sugar every hour, you\\'re going to find you do, indeed, have some peaks and valleys throughout the day. That\\'s normal.

Over my many years of highly specialized practice, I have heard that comment very often, nearly word for word. Patients can procrastinate and delay having elective procedures because their need is not related to serious medical illness or dangerous consequences. If you broke your arm, you would need an orthopedic surgeon to set the fracture. If your appendix burst, you cant dilly-dally and put off having a general surgeon perform your appendectomy. But, cosmetic plastic surgery is always elective. What that means is that you elect to have it done when you want to have it done, by whom you want to have it done, and how you want to have it done. It is all a matter of choice  not necessity. However, what we have learned from patients is that often they waited too long. They could have enjoyed the benefit of the surgery much earlier. One patient said, For years, I didnt like my nose and I couldnt breathe through it. Why I waited so long to have it corrected makes no sense. Another patient who was having the chemical skin peel, a non-surgical process to permanently remove wrinkles, age spots and other facial imperfections said, All these years, I spent a fortune on makeup and skin treatments, both prescription and non-prescription, and they didnt do a darn thing. I should have just gone ahead and had the right procedure done. Here are the five most common reasons people delay, defer and procrastinate: 1. They have more pressing issues in their life. Certainly a sick child, a divorce or a parent who needs help are reasons that come first. 2. Finances. Not everyone has the discretionary funds to do it at a given point. Often, there is a right time and a wrong time to do it depending on how much money you have in the bank. I never recommend doing cosmetic elective surgery with your last dollar. 3. Patients have an unrealistic fear of anesthesia. Today, anesthesia is safer than ever. Cosmetic elective procedures are done under very light anesthetic techniques with rapid recovery and very little chance of nausea and vomiting. 4. I was always afraid of what I would look like. Well, that shouldnt be a mystery. With computer imaging, you can see the predicted results of your procedure on a computer screen, even yours at home. And, if you have seen surgical results that dont look right to you, just dont go to the surgeon who showed you those results. If patients look unnatural, over-done with a too-tight face lift or an overpinched and scooped nose, just stay away from that doctor. 5. I was afraid of what other people might think. To me, that is a weak reason. You do it for yourself. Not for your parents, not for your friends, not even for your spouse. You do cosmetic plastic surgery because you want it.

A healthy diet can go a long way toward preventing high blood pressure. Trying following the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension eating plan, also known as the DASH diet, which emphasizes plenty of fruits and vegetables and low-fat or nonfat dairy products. Studies conducted by the National Institutes of Health have shown that the DASH diet can dramatically lower blood pressure. And the results show up fast ? often within two weeks. At the same time, cut down on salt (sodium chloride), which can raise blood pressure. The National High Blood Pressure Education Program recommends no more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium a day. The ideal is even lower ? only 1,500. For the average man, who consumes about 4,200 milligrams a day, that requires a big change. But studies show that the lower your salt intake, the lower your blood pressure. Along with a healthier diet, it is smart to be as active as possible to prevent high blood pressure. In 2007, researchers at the University of Minnesota published results from a study of almost 4,000 people between the ages of 15 and 30 who were followed over time. The more active they were, the lower their risk of developing hypertension. A few other changes can also keep your blood pressure in check. Both excessive alcohol consumption and smoking can raise blood pressure. Men who drink alcohol should stick to no more than two standard drinks a day.

This type of high blood pressure is called essential hypertension. Though essential hypertension remains somewhat mysterious, it has been linked to certain risk factors. High blood pressure tends to run in families and is more likely to affect men than women. Age and race also play a role. In the U.S., blacks are twice as likely as whites to have high blood pressure, although the gap begins to narrow around age 44. After age 65, black women have the highest incidence of high blood pressure. Essential hypertension is also greatly influenced by diet and lifestyle. The link between salt and high blood pressure is especially compelling. People living on the northern islands of Japan eat more salt per capita than anyone else in the world and have the highest incidence of essential hypertension. By contrast, people who add no salt to their food show virtually no traces of essential hypertension. Many people with high blood pressure are \"salt sensitive,\" meaning that anything more than the minimal bodily need for salt is too much for them and increases their blood pressure. Other factors that have been associated with essential hypertension include obesity; diabetes; stress; insufficient intake of potassium, calcium, and magnesium; lack of physical activity; and chronic alcohol consumption. Secondary Hypertension When a direct cause for high blood pressure can be identified, the condition is described as secondary hypertension. Among the known causes of secondary hypertension, kidney disease ranks highest. Hypertension can also be triggered by tumors or other abnormalities that cause the adrenal glands (small glands that sit atop the kidneys) to secrete excess amounts of the hormones that elevate blood pressure. Birth control pills -- specifically those containing estrogen -- and pregnancy can boost blood pressure, as can medications that constrict blood vessels.

With asthma, there is inflammation of the air passages that results in a temporary narrowing of the airways that carry oxygen to the lungs. This results in asthma symptoms, including coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness. Some people refer to asthma as \"bronchial asthma.\" Even though there are seemingly miraculous treatments for asthma symptoms, asthma is still a serious -- even dangerous -- disease that affects more than 22 million Americans and causes nearly 2 million emergency room visits ever year. With proper asthma treatment, you can live well with this condition. Yet inadequate asthma treatment limits the ability to exercise and be active. Poorly controlled asthma can lead to multiple visits to the emergency room and even hospital admission, which can affect your performance at home and work. There are three major features of asthma: 1. Airway obstruction. During normal breathing, the bands of muscle that surround the airways are relaxed, and air moves freely. But in people with asthma, allergy-causing substances and environmental triggers make the bands of muscle surrounding the airways tighten, and air cannot move freely. Less air causes a person to feel short of breath, and the air moving through the tightened airways causes a whistling sound known as wheezing. (Fortunately, this airway narrowing is reversible, a feature that distinguishes asthma from other lung diseases such as bronchitis or emphysema.) 2. Inflammation. People with asthma have red and swollen bronchial tubes. This inflammation is thought to contribute greatly to the long-term damage that asthma can cause to the lungs. And, therefore, treating this inflammation is key to managing asthma in the long run. 3. Airway irritability. The airways of people with asthma are extremely sensitive. The airways tend to overreact and narrow due to even the slightest triggers such as pollen, animal dander, dust, or fumes.

Asthma and allergies are much more common in people with a family history of asthma or allergies. The factors which worsen asthma vary from individual to individual.

Common asthma triggers include: Allergies, such as to house dust mites, cockroaches, cats, dogs, molds, mice, and grass, weed, and tree pollens Infections, colds, influenza, and other respiratory viruses Irritants, such as strong odors from perfumes or cleaning solutions, air pollution, and especially smoke from tobacco, incense, candles, or fires Exercise, especially in dry or cold environments Cold or dry weather and changes in temperature and\/or humidity, such as with thunderstorms Strong emotions, such as anxiety, laughter, or crying (which can cause heavy breathing) Reflux of acid from the stomach (GERD) Pain medications, such as aspirin or NSAIDs (10% of those with asthma are aspirin and NSAID sensitive) ","votes":"13","membertype":null,"helpful":"12","title":"What causes asthma?","url":"http:\/\/answers.webmd.com\/answers\/1178923\/what-causes-asthma","membername":null,"membervotes":null},{"descr":"","questionId":"5001926","followers":"242","ans":"Great question!

Many of my patients are in tears, I understand! The situation can be more embarrassing and expensive if the hair is not removed properly. First, ask your doctor to help you determine the reason why you have facial hair. You deserve to know the cause, especially if it\\'s associated with abnormal hormone levels. You may need to address other medical issues, in addition to removing hair. After you\\'ve determined the cause, the good news is that there are options available to remove your facial hair. The closest to permanent removal is laser hair removal (LHR). It is extremely important to make sure that the place you choose has a physician that is experienced with performing LHR on individuals of all skin types and skin complexions. In LHR a laser is directed through the skin to the hair follicle; this in turn stops the hair growth. A patient may require between 4 to 6 treatments, depending on the area. Maintaining monthly appointments will give you the best results. If you need to remove facial hair in between appointments, it is important that you shave only because the laser is attracted to the hair follicle. Vaniqa (eflornithine HCl) is a topical cream your physician can prescribe to reduce the growth of unwanted facial hair. Vaniqa works by blocking the enzymes in the follicle that are necessary for the hair to grow. Most woman see result within 6 to 8 weeks, and it is safe for woman of all skin types and ethnic backgrounds. Here are some other options. If you can get over the old tale that shaving makes you have more hair, then shaving is one safe option. Shaving is fairly inexpensive and can last up to five days. For best results use a razor that has a protective tip, along with warm water and a moisturizing shaving cream. Shave in the direction the hair grows to avoid hair bumps and apply a moisturizer to the area after shaving. Shaving does not cause more hair to grow; it just cuts the hair in the middle of the hair shaft, the thickest part. Depilatory lotions, such as Nair, dissolve hair as it reacts to the protein structure of the hair. Hair can then be rinsed off or wiped away. These creams work quickly and results can last up to two weeks. Inflammation or a rash can occur in individuals with sensitive skin. Try a test spot first, to see how your skin reacts. Be sure to read and follow all the instructions on the product label. I do not suggest that you use methods that pull hair from the root, such as waxing , electrolysis, or tweezing. Not only are these methods painful, there is a risk of scarring when using these methods to remove facial hair. Take your time in seeking out what method will work best for you, remember, it is your face.

We all want healthy shiny hair. Here are several tips to help in preventing split ends. 1. Do not brush your hair while it is wet; instead opt for a wide-tooth comb. After you wash your hair, it is up to 25% more elastic and more vulnerable to damage. 2. Try to avoid using heated hair appliances on a daily basis. Using blow dryers, curling irons, flat irons, etc. every day can dry out and damage your hair. Heat can be especially damaging to your ends. Instead of using a curling iron, try sleeping in rollers to maintain your hairstyle. To maintain a straight hairstyle, wrap your hair at night and sleep in a silk scarf. To wrap your hair, start at the crown of your head, and brush your hair around your head. Continue until all your hair is brushed around smooth. If you have a lot of hair, try using bobby pins to keep your hair in place. 3. Wear a silk scarf or a satin bonnet before going to bed. A scarf will reduce friction and protect your tresses as you sleep. If you do not like to cover your head when you sleep, you can try using a satin pillow case. 4. Do not use rubber bands to tie back your pony tail. Rubber bands can pull your hair out and break it off. 5. Trim your ends every 6 to 8 weeks. If you are trying to grow out your hair you can go 8 to 10 weeks between having your ends trimmed. 6. Before you shampoo your hair, wet your hair with warm water to open the hair cuticle. Always condition your hair after you shampoo. When you rinse the conditioner from your hair, use cold water to help seal the cuticles of your hair. 7. Do not over brush your hair. Brushing your hair 100 strokes per day for healthy hair is purely a myth; this will cause more harm than good for your hair. 8. Eat a well-balanced diet. What you put inside your body will affect your appearance on the outside of your body. Foods containing folic acid, Biotin,and Omega3 are always a great nutritional addition for your hair. 9. Try to avoid chemically treating your hair. Relaxers, perms and certain color treatments can also cause damage to your tresses.

So I found this, it should help you to decide. Below are the numerous health and nutrition benefits of eating mangoes: Anti cancer: The phenols in mangoes, such as quercetin, isoquercitrin, astragalin, fisetin, gallic acid and methylgallat, as well as the abundant enzymes, have cancer-preventing capacities. Mango is also high in a soluble dietary fiber known as pectin. Scientist have identified a strong link between eating lots of fiber and a lower risk of cancers of the gastrointestinal tract. A cup of sliced mangoes (around 165 gram) contain 76 percent of the needed daily value of vitamin C, a potent antioxidant which helps protect cells from free radical damage and reduces risk of cancer. Eye health: One cup of sliced mangoes supplies 25 percent of the needed daily value of vitamin A, which promotes good eyesight. Eating mangoes regularly prevents night blindness, refractive errors, dryness of the eyes, softening of the cornea, itching and burning in the eyes. Helps in digestion: Mangoes contain digestive enzymes that help break down proteins and aid digestion. It is also valuable to combat acidity and poor digestion because of an enzyme found in the fruit which soothes the stomach. Due to the high amounts of fiber found in mango, it can be a helpful in keeping you regular, thereby helping or preventing constipation. In India, a decoction of the mango peel is given to people with inflammation of the stomach mucus membranes. Eating one or two small tender mangoes in which the seed is not fully formed with salt and honey is found to be very effective medicine for summer diarrhoea, dysentery, piles, morning sickness, chronic dyspepsia, indigestion and constipation. Benefits to skin: Mango is effective in relieving clogged pores of the skin. What this means is that people who suffer from acne, which is caused by clogged pores, will benefit from mango. Just remove the mango pulp and apply it on your skin for about 10 minutes before washing it. Eating mango regularly makes the complexion fair and the skin soft and shining. Helps in diabetes: Mango leaves help normalize insulin levels in the blood. Boil a few mango leaves in water and allow it to saturate through the night. Consume the filtered decoction in the morning for diabetic home remedy. The glycemic index of mango is low, ranging between 41-60. So, mango does not have any significant effect in increasing blood sugar levels. For better sex: The Vitamin E that is abundantly present in mangoes helps to regulate sex hormones and boosts sex drive. Beneficial for anemia: Mangoes are beneficial for pregnant women and individuals suffering from anemia because of their iron content. Also, vitamin C in the mango enhances the absorption of iron from vegetable food like rice. Generally women after menopause become weak and they should take mangoes and other fruits rich in iron. Boost memory: Mangoes are useful to children who lack concentration in studies as it contains Glutamine acid which is good to boost memory and keep cells active. Avoid heat stroke: Unripe mangoes, a rich source of pectin, when steamed and juiced with cumin (jeera), rock salt and sugar, provide an excellent remedy for heat stroke and heat exhaustion in summer. Weight gain: Mangoes can be beneficial for people wanting to gain weight. A 100 gram of mango contains about 75 calories. Also, raw mangoes contain starch which get converted into sugar as the fruit ripens. So ripe and sweet mangoes when consumed with milk (rich in protein) can be very helpful in weight gain Do hope this helps you.

There can be hundreds of causes, involving nearly every body system, but commonly in the inner ear. Vertigo can also arise from the brain itself. The mechanism of vertigo is very complex. People with vertigo will tend to use words such as spinning, tilting, swaying, or rotating. Vertigo is a hallucination or feeling of movement. The most common type of vertigo is a sensation that a persons surroundings are spinning around them. A subjective sensation (the feeling that the patient himself is spinning) is also reported. The vertigo sensation most often arises from a part of the inner ear - the semicircular canals. Under normal conditions, the position and movements of the head are detected by tiny hair cells in the semicircular canals. Movements cause hair cells to transmit impulses to the brain. Calcium carbonate crystals or otoliths that are usually embedded in the membrane may occasionally float freely within the fluid of the semicircular canals. When free-floating crystals migrate to the far ends of the semicircular canal, these crystals cause a person to sense movement when there is none. The various tests that are performed (MRI, CT scans, ENG, etc.) are all important to help pinpoint the location of the problem. Unfortunately, a cause is often not found in many cases, so people (and their medical providers) are often left frustrated. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common cause of vertigo. The person usually describes bouts of recurring vertigo lasting several minutes or less. Episodes may be as brief as 15 seconds. Specific movements of the head often provoke the attack, usually following a brief delay of several seconds. Patients can often indicate the specific head motion or motions, which tend to trigger an attack. Nystagmus (the rapid twitching of the eyes) is often associated with the vertigo of BPPV. Hearing loss and tinnitus are not associated with BPPV. The second most common cause of vertigo is labyrinthitis , also termed or vestibular neuritis. The disease is thought to be a sequel of a viral infection, like a simple cold or even the herpes virus. It is gradual in onset, reaches maximal intensity within one hour, and resolves within 24 hours. The episode is associated with nausea and vomiting. Hearing loss may or may not be seen. There is often a significant phase of dysequilibrium (balance problems) that may persist from days to months. Mnires disease, acoustic neuromas, medication side effects, otitis media (middle ear infections), sinusitis, migraines, trauma, brainstem dysfunction, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, reactive hypoglycemia, anemia, hypovolemia (loss of blood), hypoxia (low oxygen), hyperventilation syndrome, epilepsy, heart rhythm problems and other heart disease, and various neurological disorders all can cause vertigo. There are even psychogenic causes. Seeing a specialist that has some expertise in vertigo and balance disorders is often the best way to go. Many of these specialists are associated with large, university-based medical centers. I often recommend that patients have a consultation at this level.

I have always found it a little bit awkward to comment on my patients exercise tolerance with such simple qualifiers as fair or very good for age. The truth is, if you have never actually performed an exercise test, you dont really have a great context for judging others prowess. The Bruce protocol was developed by Dr. Robert Bruce in 1963, and was only part of an impressive career, which has since defined him as the Father of Exercise Cardiology. His exercise protocol, which increases treadmill grade by 2 percent and speed by approximately 0.8 mph every three minutes, provides a pretty intense cardiac workout in a very short period of time. Its value, in addition to gauging fitness, is in assessing ones risk of having coronary artery disease, as well as predicting peri-operative and longer-term cardiac risk. Back in the 1960s, this was a very progressive approach to standardizing how doctors evaluated their patients. Dr. Bruce reportedly said, You would never buy a used car without taking it out for a drive and seeing how the engine performed while it was running, and the same is true for evaluating the function of the heart. A few weeks ago, my cardiology office decided to take Dr. Bruces ideas to heart, and practice what we preach. Medical assistants, nurses and the rare physician jumped on the treadmill in turn, and we let the Bruce protocol do its thing. Im happy to report that we did pretty well overall. A few of our, um, younger employees completed the final stage  think competitive cyclists and sub-three hour marathoners. Our physicians, alas, werent quite as impressive, but at least we had age on our side I was psyched to complete the fifth stage of the protocol, but was pretty wiped out for the rest of the afternoon (and the following afternoon, too). But it gave me new respect for what we put our patients through, and also gives me a better frame of reference to evaluate them. One of the interesting side effects of formal exercise testing is that taking the test appears to motivate participants to make healthy changes in their own lives. One study reported that 63 percent of patients modified risky behaviors after being tested. As for me, it inspired me to reach a new type of fitness goal  Stage 6, here I come!

Infuse your diet with soy. Soy has been proven to reduce testosterone levels, which will in turn reduce libido. Then theres this, eating a low-fat diet. Increased consumption of fat is associated with an increase of testosterone levels, but cutting back on fats--particularly saturated fats--will help bring your sex drive down. Or try eating the herb caste tree berry. Also known as \"monk\\'s pepper,\" this supplement has been used to reduce libido since the Middle Ages. But unlike most other herbs, it has retained its use, as it has been proven over time to be effective in combating a high sex drive. But stay away from animal proteins. The proteins and hormones found in meats like beef, chicken, pork and turkey can contribute to high testosterone levels. Vegetarians tend to have lower testosterone levels than omnivores, and thus lower libidos. How about exercising more frequently, working out reduces your testosterone levels while increasing cortisol. Marathon runners frequently have lower-than-average testosterone levels because of this. And one other thing its that during the Second World War the British Army put bromide in servicemen\\'s tea to lower their libido, and they also done that to reservists after the war, who went away for a weeks training, ever thought of trying to tell the wife why? And I think you find that the American forces also did something of the same. Visit your doctor and ask about medications that might lower your sex drive. Your options will vary depending on your medical history, but there are multiple pills you can be prescribed to help you win the battle against an overactive sex drive. Do hope something here helps.

Ipecac will reliably cause vomiting about 20-30 minutes after its given, so the idea was that you could at least get your child to vomit back the poison. We know now that advice to keep ipecac handy and use it after poisonous ingestions was wrong. Though it does cause vomiting, that 20-30 minute lag in effectiveness means that in many cases, the poison has already been absorbed, or has at least traveled beyond the stomach so it cant be brought back up. Some ingested things cause as much damage on the way out as when they were eaten, and vomiting them will only make things worse. Most importantly, drinking ipecac will prevent emergency physicians from being able to use truly effective treatments for ingestion, such as activated charcoal or medical antidotes. There are current no situations where national poison control centers advice the use of ipecac, and the American Academy of Pediatrics does not recommend parents keep ipecac in their house. If you think someone has ingested something poisonous, your best next step is to call the nationwide poison control center at 1-800-222-1222 in the US. Try to have the most important information available to discuss: what was ingested, when was it ingested, who took it, and how much was ingested.

It is characterized by inflammation of the liver and\/or liver damage caused by an attack on the liver by a person\\'s own immune system. This disease was first recognized in 1950, when it was noted that the condition primarily affected young women who stopped menstruating (a condition known as amenorrhea); who suffered from arthritis; who had a severe form of chronic hepatitis that rapidly progressed to cirrhosis; and who had an elevated protein (gamma globulin) found on their blood tests. Some similarities between AIH and systemic lupus erythematosus ((SLE)) another autoimmune disease, led to AIH being named lupoid hepatitis in 1956. Presently, much more is known about AIH. For starters, it has been confirmed that AIH and SLE are two totally separate disorders. Thus, the term \"lupoid hepatitis\" is no longer used. Furthermore, it has been established that despite a greater occurrence rate among young women - women account for approximately 70 to 80 percent of cases - AIH may also occur in men, and it may occur in either gender at any age. Finally, case studies have established that AIH has varying manifestations. It is not always a severe, rapidly progressive disease, as originally believed. In fact, it may have a mild, asymptomatic (without symptoms) natural history. AIH occurs in about 100,000 to 200,000 people in the United States at any given time, and it accounts for approximately 10- 20% of chronic hepatitis cases in the world. Approximately 6% of liver transplantations in the United States are performed due to AIH. It was originally believed that the disease most commonly manifested itself at either of two age intervals - peripubertally (around 13 years old), or around fifty to sixty years old. It is now known that AIH can develop at any age, and has been diagnosed in infants as well as in people in their seventies. However, in most cases, a patient with AIH is over 40 years old at the time of initial visit to a specialist.

Lupus is not \t\t contagious. No one knows exactly what causes the body to attack \t\t its own tissues. A person may be born with a certain \t\t genetic makeup that affects how the \t\t immune system functions or makes him or her at risk \t\t for lupus. A combination of factors can trigger the autoimmune process, some of \t\t which may affect one person but not another. 1 Exposure to ultraviolet light, usually from \t\t\t sunlight, is known to trigger the disease process and symptom \t\t\t flares. Hormonal factors are linked to autoimmune disease , though \t\t\t the link is poorly understood. Some research shows an increased risk of lupus \t\t\t with higher levels of estrogen . But a separate study did not find evidence that \t\t\t the hormones \t\t\t estrogen or \t\t\t prolactin taken for hormone replacement therapy or \t\t\t birth control , or taken previously for fertility treatments , increased the risk \t\t\t of lupus. 2 Another study showed that women with stable \t\t\t lupus had no increased risk of symptom flares from taking birth control \t\t\t pills. 3 Smoking may increase the risk of \t\t\t getting lupus and may make the disease more severe. Some \t\t\t medications are suspected triggers of lupus and \t\t\t symptom flares. Some infections are suspected triggers. Some people \t\t\t who have \t\t\t cytomegalovirus (CMV) , parvovirus (such as \t\t\t fifth disease ), and \t\t\t hepatitis C infections eventually develop lupus. The \t\t\t Epstein-Barr virus has been linked to lupus in \t\t\t children. Chemical exposure has been known to trigger lupus. \t\t\t Suspected chemical toxins include trichloroethylene in well water and silica \t\t\t dust. Hair dyes and straighteners, linked to lupus in the past, are no longer \t\t\t considered to be lupus triggers.

Thus, it is difficult to assess their potential effectiveness in controlling swine influenza A (H1N1) virus transmission in these settings. In the absence of clear scientific data, the interim recommendations below have been developed on the basis of public health judgment and the historical use of facemasks and respirators in other settings. In areas with confirmed human cases of swine influenza A (H1N1) virus infection, the risk for infection can be reduced through a combination of actions. No single action will provide complete protection, but an approach combining the following steps can help decrease the likelihood of transmission. These actions include frequent handwashing, covering coughs, and having ill persons stay home, except to seek medical care, and minimize contact with others in the household. Additional measures that can limit transmission of a new influenza strain include voluntary home quarantine of members of households with confirmed or probable swine influenza cases, reduction of unnecessary social contacts, and avoidance whenever possible of crowded settings. When it is absolutely necessary to enter a crowded setting or to have close contact with persons who might be ill, the time spent in that setting should be as short as possible. If used correctly, facemasks and respirators may help reduce the risk of getting influenza, but they should be used along with other preventive measures, such as avoiding close contact and maintaining good hand hygiene. A respirator that fits snugly on your face can filter out small particles that can be inhaled around the edges of a facemask, but compared with a facemask it is harder to breathe through a respirator for long periods of time. When crowded settings or close contact with others cannot be avoided, the use of facemasks or respirators in areas where transmission of swine influenza A (H1N1) virus has been confirmed should be considered as follows: Whenever possible, rather than relying on the use of facemasks or respirators, close contact with people who might be ill and being in crowded settings should be avoided. Facemasks should be considered for use by individuals who enter crowded settings, both to protect their nose and mouth from other people\\'s coughs and to reduce the wearers\\' likelihood of coughing on others; the time spent in crowded settings should be as short as possible. Respirators should be considered for use by individuals for whom close contact with an infectious person is unavoidable. This can include selected individuals who must care for a sick person (e.g., family member with a respiratory infection) at home. These interim recommendations will be revised as new information about the use of facemasks and respirators in the current setting becomes available.

A safe diet should include all of the recommended daily allowances (RDAs) for vitamins, minerals, and protein. The diet should be lower in calories (energy) only, not in essential vitamins or minerals. In general, a diet containing 1,000 to 1,200 calories a day should be selected for most women; a diet between 1,200 calories per day and 1,600 calories per day should be chosen for men, however, speak with your doctor first. Slow, steady weight loss. The program should be directed toward slow, steady weight loss unless your doctor feels your health condition would benefit from more rapid weight loss. Expect to lose only about a pound a week after the first week or two. With many calorie-restricted diets, there is an initial rapid weight loss during the first one to two weeks, but this loss is largely fluid. The initial rapid loss of fluid also is regained rapidly when you return to a normal-calorie diet. Thus, a reasonable goal of weight loss should be expected. The rate of weight loss should be one to two pounds each week. When inquiring about a commercial weight loss program, be sure you are provided with a detailed statement of fees and costs of additional items such as dietary supplements or foods. Other important questions to ask of any potential weight loss program include: Does the staff consist of qualified counselors and health professionals such as registered dietitians, doctors, and exercise physiologists? Are food choices flexible and suitable? Are weight loss goals set by the client and\/or the health professional? What percentage of people complete the program? What is the average weight loss among people who finish the program? What percentage of people have problems or side effects? What are they? Is there a maintenance program to help keep the weight off once it\\'s lost? If you plan to lose more than 15 pounds to 20 pounds, have any health problems, or take medication on a regular basis, your doctor should evaluate you before you start a weight loss program. A doctor can assess your general health and medical conditions that might be affected by dieting and weight loss. Also, a doctor should be able to recommend appropriate programs and help you come up with a sensible weight loss goal. If you plan to use a very-low-calorie diet, you definitely should be examined and monitored by a doctor. Your weight loss program should include plans for weight maintenance after the weight loss phase is over. It is of little benefit to lose a large amount of weight only to regain it. Weight maintenance is the most difficult part of controlling weight and is not consistently implemented in weight loss programs. The program you select should help you improve your dietary habits, increase your physical activity, and help you change other lifestyle habits that may have contributed to your weight gain in the past. Being overweight is too often viewed as a temporary problem that can be treated for a few months with a strenuous diet. However, as most overweight people know, weight control must be considered a lifelong effort.

It is what it is.....if you love kids, understand that these things just happen despite futile preventive efforts Your grand-daughter will get her chance to start and spread her own infectious disease in the future; start her own mini-epidemic...and get even. These minor diseases, though very inconvenient, help her build a stronger immune system to fight off more dangerous diseases, just like vaccines.

This is why people should always try to maintain good hygiene (e.g. handwashing) so they can minimize their chance of spreading or getting infections. You should stay home while you are sick with hand, foot, and mouth disease. Talk with your healthcare provider if you are not sure when you should return to work or school.

Celiac disease patients vary in their tolerance of gluten; some patients can ingest small amounts of gluten without developing symptoms while others experience massive diarrhea with only minute amounts of gluten. The standard treatment calls for complete avoidance of gluten for life. The principles of a gluten-free diet include: In most patients, a gluten-free diet will result in improvements in symptoms within weeks. Many patients report symptom improvements within 48 hours. In children with celiac disease, the response to a gluten-free diet can be dramatic. Not only will diarrhea and abdominal discomfort subside, but behavior also improves, and growth resumes (with rapid catch-up in height). These improvements in symptoms are followed by reappearance of intestinal villi. Complete normalization of the intestinal villi may take months. In many adult patients, the improvement in symptoms is followed by only partial regeneration of intestinal villi. In patients with dermatitis herpetiformis, the skin lesions also improve with a gluten-free diet. Many individuals with celiac disease may not understand the importance of life-long adherence to a gluten free diet. A recent study found that among patients diagnosed at least 20 years earlier with celiac disease, only half of the patients were following a strict gluten-free diet. The primary reason that patients followed the diet was to prevent symptoms-not to prevent complications. There was evidence of mild iron deficiency and abnormal bone density in one-third of the patients, suggesting that the lack of adherence to the diet was having health consequences.

My wife has also lived with COPD for more than 15 years. Based upon what Ive seen and read, living permanently in high altitude location can have deleterious consequences for COPD suffers. Stage 4 represents very severe COPD. Symptoms have gotten worse over time, mucus production may be greater, and COPD suffers often rely on oxygen therapy. The good news is that you can live for many more years even with the progression of the disease being at its poorest stage. I recommend that you discuss your current lung functioning with your pulmonologist. They know you best and can best assess your health needs based on the most recent scientific evidence. Of course we are all distinct individuals who will respond differently to varying climate changes. There are many anecdotal stories of COPD patients faring well in high altitudes. But most legitimate medical studies have demonstrated that long-term residence at high altitudes is associated with increased mortality. COPD patients living in high altitude locations, at all stages of the disease process, tended to die at a younger age. They also tended to die after a shorter duration of illness when compared to sea-level patients. I personally wouldnt maintain my primary home in a high altitude area with stage 4 COPD. There is plenty of scientific evidence to suggest that long-term residence at high altitude is a potential problem for COPD patients.
